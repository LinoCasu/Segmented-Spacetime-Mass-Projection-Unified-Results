# Performance Analysis V1 - Critical Issues Found

**Performance:** 11.8% wins (15/127) - **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE!**

## Root Cause Analysis:

### Issue 1: Δ(M) Formula Scale Problem

**Observed:**
```
Mean Δ(M)%: 1.5067%
Max Δ(M)%: 1.9170%
φ-correction factor: 1.0151 (mean)
```

**Expected:**
```
Δ(M)% should be 5-20% for strong corrections
φ-correction factor should be 1.05-1.20
```

**Problem:** The exponential term is vanishing!

```python
deltaM_pct = (A * exp(-ALPHA * r_s) + B) * norm
            = (98.01 * exp(-2.7177e4 * r_s) + 1.96) * norm

For typical r_s ~ 1000-10000 m:
exp(-2.7177e4 * 1000) = exp(-2.7e7) ≈ 0

Result: deltaM_pct ≈ B * norm ≈ 1.96 * norm ≈ 1.9%
```

**This is TOO SMALL!** The formula is not working as intended.

## Hypothesis:

The ALPHA parameter might be meant for a DIFFERENT unit of r_s, or the formula structure is wrong!
