## üë• How External Contributors Work

### For Everyone Else (Not Owners):

**You CANNOT push directly to this repository.**

**Correct Workflow:**

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # On GitHub: Click "Fork" button
   # This creates YOUR copy: your-username/Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results
   ```

2. **Clone YOUR Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results
   cd Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results
   ```

3. **Make Changes in Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name  # This pushes to YOUR fork only!
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Go to GitHub
   - Navigate to your fork
   - Click "Pull Request"
   - Request merge into `error-wtf/Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results:main`
   - Wait for owner review

5. **Owners Review & Merge**
   - Carmen/Lino review your PR
   - If approved: They merge into main
   - If changes needed: You update your fork
   - **You never push to main directly**

## üìö Documentation Commands Explained

### Why Git Push Commands Are in Documentation

**You may see commands like:**
```bash
git push origin main
```

**These are NOT for:**
- ‚ùå External contributors

**If you try to push without permission:**
```
remote: Permission to error-wtf/Segmented-Spacetime-Mass-Projection-Unified-Results.git denied.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/error-wtf/...': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

**You will get HTTP 403 Forbidden error.**
