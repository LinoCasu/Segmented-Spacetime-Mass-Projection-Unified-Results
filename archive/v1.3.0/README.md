## Why These Were Archived

**Repository Cleanup (v1.3.1):**
- Removed "*_OLD*" and "*_BACKUP*" files from root directory
- Archived for historical reference but not part of active codebase
- Prevents confusion about which version is current

**Best Practices:**
- Old versions archived, not deleted (preserves history)
- Git provides version control; no need for *_OLD suffixes
- Clear separation between active code and historical reference
