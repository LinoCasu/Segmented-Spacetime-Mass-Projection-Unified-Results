ABSTRACT

Context. The surroundings of Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars are excellent
laboratories to study the eﬀects of their high UV
radiation, powerful winds, and strong ejection
events onto the surrounding gas and dust.
Aims. We aim at determining the physical parameters of the
dense gas near G79.29+0.46, an LBV-candidate located at the centre of
two concentric infrared rings
which may interact with the infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G79.3+0.3.
Methods. The Eﬀelsberg 100 m
telescope was used to observe the NH3(1,1), (2,2) emission in a ﬁeld of view of 7(cid:48) ×
7(cid:48) including the
infrared rings and a part of the IRDC. In addition, we observed particular
positions in the NH3(3,3) transition toward the strongest
region of the IRDC, which is also closest
to the ring nebula.
Results. We report here the ﬁrst coherent ring-like structure of dense NH3 gas
associated with an evolved massive star. It is well traced
in both ammonia lines, surrounding an
already known infrared ring nebula; its column density is two orders of magnitude lower than
the
IRDC. The NH3 emission in the IRDC is characterized by a low and uniform rotational temperature
(Trot ∼ 10 K) and moderately
high opacities in the (1,1) line. The rest of the observed ﬁeld is
spotted by warm or hot zones (Trot > 30 K) and characterized by
optically thin emission of the (1,1)
line. The NH3 abundances are about 10−8 in the IRDC, and 10−10–10−9 elsewhere. The warm
temperatures
and low abundances of NH3 in the ring suggest that the gas is being heated and photo-dissociated by
the intense UV
ﬁeld of the LBV star. An outstanding region is found to the south-west (SW) of the
LBV star within the IRDC. The NH3 (3,3)
emission at the centre of the SW region reveals two velocity
components tracing gas at temperatures > 30 K. Of particular interest
is the northern edge of the SW
region, which coincides with the border of the ring nebula and a region of strong 6 cm continuum
emission; here, the opacity of the (1,1) line and the NH3 abundance do not decrease as expected in a
typical clump of an isolated
cold dark cloud. This strongly suggests some kind of interaction
between the ring nebula (powered by the LBV star) and the IRDC.
We ﬁnally discuss the possibility of
NH3 evaporation from the dust grain mantles due to the already known presence of low-velocity
shocks
in the area.
Conclusions. The detection of the NH3 associated with this LBV ring nebula, as well as
the special characteristics of the northern
border of the SW region, conﬁrm that the surroundings of
G79.29+0.46 constitutes an exemplary scenario, which is worth to be
studied in detail by other
molecular tracers and higher angular resolutions.

1. Introduction

Massive stars are probably the most important sources provid-
ing
thermal and mechanical energy to the interstellar medium
(ISM). They are few in number and remain on
the Main Se-
quence during some million years only. One of the shortest (up
to a few 104 yr) and
most spectacular stages of their evolution is
reached when they become luminous blue variable (LBV)
stars.
With bolometric luminosities > 3×105 L(cid:12), LBV stars are charac-
terized by their heavy
mass loss and both photometric and spec-
troscopic variability, and are supposed to be the
progenitors of
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars (Langer et al. 1994; Maeder & Meynet
1994) or, as suggested by
other authors, even the direct progeni-
tors of type II supernovae with dense circumstellar material
(e. g.
Gal-Yam et al. 2007; Smith 2007). A key subject of current study
about the LBV stars is the
mechanism which drives the vari-

ability and episodic mass ejections. Since the winds and mass
ejections leave their ﬁngerprints on the surrounding material, the
study of the distribution,
composition and physical properties of
the circumstellar gas and dust would put constraints on the
stellar
wind models (e. g. Garcia-Segura & Mac Low 1995).

This circumstellar material, at up to 1
pc distance from the
star, has been traditionally studied in the optical/IR, tracing emis-
sion
nebulae consisting of ionized and neutral atomic gas and the
(often) warm dust. However, the LBV
environment is presum-
ably also rich in molecules, (1) because the stars are active dust
producers
and (2) because there should be shocks, caused by the
stellar wind, triggering a shock induced
chemistry. In addition,
since the atmospheric abundances of LBVs are expected to be
He-enriched and
near nuclear-CNO equilibrium, it is theoreti-
cally expected that the ejecta from LBVs will be rich
in nitro-
genated species (e. g. Smith et al. 1998, and references therein).

A clear-cut case of an
environment rich in molecules is
NGC 2359. In this WR nebula, Rizzo et al. (2001a) have de-
tected
the NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) metastable lines, which was the
ﬁrst detection of a polyatomic molecule in
the surroundings of
an evolved massive star. NH3 was detected towards a peak of the
CO emission
(Rizzo et al. 2001b, 2003a), in coincidence with
other complex molecules (such as HCO+, CS, CN, and
HCN;
see Rizzo et al. 2003b). These ﬁndings revealed the presence
of dense and warm molecular gas,
which can be traced by N-
bearing molecules. The high ammonia abundance and kinetic
temperature
derived (10−8 and 30 K, respectively) are interpreted
in terms of a shock-induced chemistry. The
same molecules de-
tected in NGC 2359 (and some isotopomers) were later reported
in the Homunculus,
the circumstellar nebula around the well
known LBV η Carina (Smith et al. 2006; Loinard et al.
2012).

Among the N-bearing molecules usually studied, NH3 is par-
ticularly interesting due to its
relatively high abundance and
ubiquity. Moreover, its properties allow an accurate determina-
tion
of the kinetic temperature, avoiding usual observational is-
sues like calibration and pointing (Ho
& Townes 1983). The de-
tection of NH3 in the environment of NGC 2359 and η Carina
encourages
studies of additional LBV star environments.

The nebula G79.29+0.46 constitutes an excellent
testbed to
pursue this kind of studies. The combined eﬀect of the high
UV ﬁeld, the steady powerful
winds and the violent mass ejec-
tions have produced conspicuous structures in the nebula and
beyond. G79.29+0.46, ﬁrstly discovered by its free-free emis-
sion (Higgs et al. 1994), is a ring-
like nebula formed and excited
by a LBV candidate, surrounded by an outstanding pair of con-
centric
rings seen in the infrared up to 24 µm (see Fig. 1 of
Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010), which is likely
formed by mate-
rial ejected by the central object in at least two diﬀerent mass-
loss episodes. The
detection of a CO structure around the neb-
ula, as observed in the J = 2 → 1 and J = 3 → 2 lines
(Rizzo et al. 2008), demonstrated the existence of warm and/or
high-density molecular gas. Immersed
within the CO structure,
there is a higher density clump which is claimed to be associated
with the
south-western side of the infrared nebula. This work
also provided evidences for a low-velocity
shock with veloci-
ties around 14–15 km s−1 toward this CO clump. Subsequent
CO J = 4 → 3 emission
(Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010) revealed
two concentric slabs in the same region of the clump, ﬁlling
the
space between the two shells detected at 24 µm, and in coinci-
dence with a brightening of the 6
cm continuum emission of the
nebula (Umana et al. 2011).

G79.29+0.46 is part of the very complex
Cygnus X region. It
is projected in between two star-forming regions: the Hii region
DR 15 to the
south-east (see Fig. 11 of Kraemer et al. 2010),
and the infrared dark cloud IRDC G79.3+0.3
(hereafter the
IRDC) towards the southern and western borders (Redman et al.
2003). The local arm is
seen tangentially in this direction
(Dame & Thaddeus 1985; Rygl et al. 2012), which makes it dif-
ﬁcult to determine distances and to identify mutual associations
among targets associated with the
Cyg X region. An update of
the information currently available and a brief discussion of the
distance is presented below, in Sect. 5.1.

In this paper, we present NH3(1,1) and (2,2) maps
observed
with the Eﬀelsberg 100-m radio telescope towards the LBV neb-
ula G79.29+0.46 and the
nearby IRDC. In Sect. 2 we describe
the observations. In Sect. 3 we present the structure of ammo-
nia emission in diﬀerent velocity ranges, revealing a ring-like
structure associated with the
previously known infrared shell, as
well as spectra of NH3 (3,3) towards two positions in the south-
western region. In Section 4 we analyse the ammonia data in the

ﬁeld,
and study the properties of the dense gas associated with
the LBV nebula and with the IRDC. Finally,
in Sect. 5, we dis-
cuss the most relevant properties of the dense gas in the region,
and the
possible interaction of the LBV nebula with the IRDC.
The main conclusions are summarized in Sect.
6.

2. Observations
We have used the Eﬀelsberg 100-m radio telescope of the Max-
Planck-Institut für
Radioastronomie to map the distribution of
the (1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines of NH3, in a ∼
7(cid:48) × 7(cid:48) ﬁeld
around G79.29+0.46. The observations have been carried out in
March 2008.
The 1.3 cm HEMT receiver was tuned to 23.7086 GHz, a
frequency lying midway between the rest
frequencies of the two
observed lines. We have used the FFTS spectrometer, which pro-
vides a
bandwidth of 100 MHz and a frequency resolution of
∼ 6 kHz (0.08 km s−1). This spectrometer allowed
the simulta-
neous observation of the two lines, with excellent velocity res-
olution. The whole
data processing was done using the CLASS
software1. After baseline subtraction and calibration, the
spectra
have been smoothed to a resolution of 0.24 km s−1 for further
analysis.

The telescope beam
size (half power beam width, HPBW) at
the observed frequency is ∼ 40(cid:48)(cid:48), and the main
beam eﬃciency
is 0.52. We have used NGC 7027 for continuum calibration, as-
suming an absolute ﬂux
of 5.58 Jy at 23.7 GHz (Ott et al. 1994).
We have also used DR21 (close to the observed ﬁeld) as a
line
calibrator. Pointing was regularly checked, typically once every
hour, and is accurate to
within 7(cid:48)(cid:48).

We have done all the observations in position switching
mode, with the
relative reference position at 200(cid:48)(cid:48) in azimuth.
Integration times per point varied
between 5 and 10 minutes on-
source, depending on weather conditions and elevations. Due to
variable
weather the system temperature varied between 30 K
and 94 K, resulting in a rms noise (1-sigma)
between 50 mK and
350 mK for a velocity spacing of 0.24 km s−1. All temperatures
throughout this
paper are on a main-beam scale (TMB).

The whole ﬁeld was initially sampled every
40(cid:48)(cid:48). A particular
region of interest, corresponding to a multiple layered morphol-
ogy in CO (Rizzo et al. 2008) has been fully sampled (i. e. every
20(cid:48)(cid:48)); this region
is indicated in Figs. 1 to 4 by a square and is
referred to as "the SW region" hereafter.
Furthermore, two deep-integration pointed observations of
the (3,3) line were done towards speciﬁc
positions. These posi-
tions correspond to NH3 and CO peaks, as explained in Sect. 3.3.
Identical
technical conditions were applied in this case.

All the positions throughout this paper are oﬀsets
from the
equatorial coordinates (J2000.0) of the exciting star, at (RA,
Dec.) = (20h31m42s.29,
+40◦21(cid:48)59(cid:48)(cid:48). 1).

3. Results

3.1. Overall emission
The whole velocity range of
NH3 emission, from −3 km s−1
to +3 km s−1, falls within the corresponding to Cyg X and
the Great
Rift regions (Schneider et al. 2006; Gottschalk et al.
2012). Channel maps of the emission of the
(1,1) and (2,2)
lines are presented in an online appendix, and the spectra are
also accessible for
download at CDS. The velocity-integrated

Fig. 1. NH3
(1,1) line intensity map in direction to G79.29+0.46. Only
the main component has been integrated,
in the velocity range indi-
cated at the top right corner. On grayscale, the 1.2 mm continuum im-
age of the MAMBO cameras at the IRAM 30 m telescope is also plotted
(Motte et al. 2007). The
logarithmic intensity scale used is indicated in
the top bar. NH3 starting contours and spacing are
0.2 K km s−1. Equa-
torial coordinates are referred to the star position (Sect. 2). The region
was
fully sampled within the square indicated at the south west, and
every 40(cid:48)(cid:48)elsewhere.
The white contour, taken from the MAMBO data,
is plotted to indicate the boundaries of the IRDC.
Most of the NH3 (1,1)
emission seems associated with the cold dust traced by the 1.2 mm con-
tinuum,
although some low-level features are also noted (see text).

maps of both lines, in the interval
(−3, +3) km s−1, are shown
in Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 1, the (1,1) contours are superim-
posed on the
1.2 mm continuum image from the MAMBO and
MAMBO-2 cameras at the IRAM 30 m telescope (Motte et al.
2007), smoothed to an angular resolution of ∼26(cid:48)(cid:48). The ﬁgure
shows that the most
intense NH3 and 1.2 mm emission arises
from the IRDC, extending from the south-east to the west of
our
ﬁeld of view, and consisting of four main clumps. The peaks of
ammonia do not agree with those
of the 1.2 mm continuum. The
SW region (the area inside the square) is the closest in projec-
tion
to the ring of ionized nebula (Higgs et al. 1994; Umana et al.
2011). It is worth noting that while
the southern clump and the
SW region are physically connected, the connection between the
SW region
and the western clump suﬀers a discontinuity both in
dust and gas, even taking into account that
their overall structure
suggests they are part of the same large-scale cloud. There is also
some
weak emission, traced by the low-level contours; this low-
level emission is particularly visible at
the northern and western
part of the ﬁeld, and also close to its centre, near the LBV star.

The NH3
(2,2) line emission shares some of the (1,1) fea-
tures. Fig. 2 plots the NH3 (2,2) emission in the
same velocity
range as in Fig. 1. Again, the most extended emission appears
correlated to the 1.2 mm
continuum, and consequently to the
IRDC; furthermore, some emission at the centre and the west
is
also present. It is notable that the peak of the whole map arises

Fig. 2. The same as Fig. 1 for
the NH3 (2,2) line. Contours start at
0.22 K km s−1, and are spaced by 0.11 K km s−1. Although the
most
extended emission is well correlated to the dark cloud in the south and
west, the peak of the
(2,2) line arises from the (0(cid:48)(cid:48), −40(cid:48)(cid:48)) position and
is not correlated
to the 1.2 mm emission.

from a position close to the LBV star, at (0(cid:48)(cid:48),
−40(cid:48)(cid:48)). The central
part of the ﬁeld is devoid of NH3 (2,2) emission, except at the
(0(cid:48)(cid:48), −40(cid:48)(cid:48)) position.

3.2. NH3 associated with the LBV nebula

In
order to identify and further characterize the ammonia asso-
ciated with G79.29+0.46, we have
thoroughly studied the NH3
emission in diﬀerent velocity bins. After this analysis, two ve-
locity
ranges are particularly interesting. In Figs. 3 and 4, the
emission of the (1,1) and (2,2) lines are
sketched in such veloc-
ity intervals.

Figure 3 shows the ammonia emission in the velocity range
(−1.2, +0.5) km s−1, overlaid to a Herschel/PACS image at
70 µm 2. An outstanding morphological
correlation with the ring
nebula (especially in the (1,1) line) is noted in this ﬁgure, where
a
large fraction of the 70 µm ring is surrounded by an ammonia
feature. This NH3 ring-like structure
bounds the 70 µm ring to
the north and west, but is projected above it towards the south.
The (2,2)
line also shows a similar morphology, although not as
clear as the (1,1) line. The lowest-level
contours of the (1,1) and
(2,2) lines corresponds to a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio greater
than 4
and 1.5, respectively, which explains the lack of a better
correlation in the (2,2) line.

Moreover,
the inner part of the nebula is also partially ﬁlled
by (1,1) emission, without a (2,2) counterpart.
Due to the under-
sampling and the limited S/N ratio, it is not possible to deter-
mine whether a
physical connection between the ammonia ring
and the emission at the ﬁeld centre exists. If so, most
of the NH3

archive (ObsID: 1342196767).

Fig. 3. NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) integrated line emission in the velocity
range
(−1.2, +0.5) km s−1, overlaid on the 70 µm continuum of Her-
schel/PACS. The white contour is the
same depicted in Figs. 1 and 2.
The fully sample area is indicated by the white square. The white
trian-
gle (circle) points to the position of the NH3 (CO) peak. NH3(1,1) start-
ing and spacing
contours (yellow) are 0.12 and 0.06 K km s−1, respec-
tively. NH3(2,2) starting and spacing contours
(blue) are 0.04 K km s−1.
In this velocity range, the ammonia emission is dominated by a ring-like
structure towards the outer part of the ring nebula (see text).

associated with the LBV nebula
could be the surviving of a for-
merly complete NH3 shell.

Figure 4 is similar to Fig. 3, but
covers the second velocity
range of interest: (+0.5, +1.2) km s−1. Here, the NH3 emission of
both
lines is concentrated towards the SW region, approximately
at the centre of the fully sampled area.
The (2,2) line emission
also depicts a strong spot around (0(cid:48)(cid:48), −40(cid:48)(cid:48))
without a counter-
part in the (1,1) line.

The velocity of the NH3 ring does not match with the
values reported for the CO shell (see Figs. 6 and 7 of
Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010), which are
around −3 km s−1 and
+3 km s−1. This contradictory result is only apparent, because
it accounts for
intrinsic diﬀerences in the molecules under com-
parison. CO is very abundant and ubiquitous,
optically thick and
with a low critical density; therefore, it is expected the emission
of CO in
environments with a wider range of physical conditions
than NH3. The velocity of the NH3 ring ﬁts
well within the whole
range of emission associated to the CO shell (−5 to +5 km s−1;
see Rizzo et
al. 2008), but is close to the velocity of the local arm
in this direction, and also the velocity of
Cygnus X and the Great
Cygnus Rift. The velocity ranges of the CO slabs reported by
Jiménez-Esteban
et al. (2010) are merely those where the confu-
sion eﬀects are minor and a clear correlation with
the infrared
shell is noted.

In projection, the NH3 ring bounds the ring nebula and the
CO slabs,
although the presence of any positional diﬀerences
between CO and NH3 should take into consideration
the argu-
ments presented above, and the fact that the comparison is made
at diﬀerent velocities. As
we discuss below, the lack of ammonia

the the velocity range
(+0.5, +1.2) km s−1. Starting contours and spacing of the NH3 (1,1)
line (yellow) are 0.6 K km s−1 and 0.2 K km s−1, respectively. For the
NH3 (2,2) line, the starting
contours and spacing (blue) are 0.09 and
0.03 K km s−1, respectively. At this velocity range, the
ammonia emis-
sion is particularly intense towards the SW region (e.g., within the white
square), in
coincidence with the most prominent CO emission. Another
outstanding feature is the (2,2) spot
around (0(cid:48)(cid:48), −40(cid:48)(cid:48)), which has no
(1,1) counterpart.

at the ring nebula
positions is consistent with the destruction of
this molecule by the high UV ﬁeld.

3.3. NH3 (3,3)
in the SW region

We devoted a special attention to the SW region, because
it hosts a multiple
layered CO structure (Rizzo et al. 2008;
Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010), and is also claimed as a site
of in-
teraction between the LBV nebula and its environs (Umana et al.
2011).

The CO (Rizzo et al.
2008; Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010) and
dust-continuum emission (Figs. 1 and 2) are very well
correlated
in this region. Ammonia also depicts a strong and compact emis-
sion in the SW region,
although does not peak at the same po-
sition as CO and dust. Hereafter, we will refer to the peaks
of
emission of ammonia and CO as the “NH3 peak” and the “CO
peak”. The NH3 peak is near the centre
of the SW region, at
∼ (−54(cid:48)(cid:48), −131(cid:48)(cid:48)), while the CO peak is shifted
with respect to
the NH3 peak approximately by (−20(cid:48)(cid:48), +20(cid:48)(cid:48)). In order
to better
analyse these two points, we have done deep integrations of the
(3,3) line.

Both (3,3)
spectra are presented in Fig. 5, together with the
corresponding (1,1) and (2,2) lines. Dashed
velocity marks have
been added at +0.3 and +1.9 km s−1 to facilitate the compar-
isons.

The ﬁrst
feature in the ﬁgure is the lack of (3,3) emis-
sion in the CO peak. The ratio of the areas between
the
NH3 peak and the CO peak –computed in the velocity range
(+0.3, +1.9) km s−1of the (3,3) line–
is greater than 16. On the
other hand, the same ratios computed for the (1,1) and (2,2) lines
Rizzo et al.: NH3 associated with G79.29+0.46

To estimate the ammonia abundance, X(NH3), we have
used
the 1.2 mm map of Motte et al. (2007) and computed the H2 col-
umn density following Motte et
al. (1998). Assumptions and for-
mulation are also exposed in the Appendix.

In the NH3 peak of the
SW region, where the (3,3) line was
observed and detected, we proceeded with a Boltzmann diagram
approach to determine the rotational temperature and column
densities of the three velocity
components. The procedure is also
described in the Appendix.

4.2. Rotational and kinetic
temperatures

The distribution of the rotational temperatures (Trot) is sketched
in Fig. 6. The
values are written at their corresponding positions,
superimposed to a Spitzer image at 8 µm.

The
blue labels correspond to the points where the hf ﬁtting
was possible. All these positions belong to
the IRDC (as said
above), and are characterized by a very low and uniform Trot, in
the range 7 − 11
K. The points having two values of Trot corre-
spond to those cases where two velocity components
were ﬁtted.
The yellow labels correspond to those points with both lines
ﬁtted by Gaussian proﬁles,
and with derived values of Trot lower
than 40 K. In case of non-detection of the (2,2) line, the
values
are expressed as upper limits. None of these points are correlated
to the IRDC, and it is
hard to establish a tendency across the
observed ﬁeld.

The red labels correspond to those positions
where the (1,1)
line remains undetected, and therefore the values of Trot are
lower limits. These
“hot spots” are spread over the whole ob-
served ﬁeld, but again avoiding the IRDC positions. As the
hot
spots are located in the under-sampled area, we have to interpret
them as small regions (less
than 40(cid:48)(cid:48)) with special local condi-
tions. The peak of the (2,2) line in Fig. 4
–oﬀset (0(cid:48)(cid:48), −40(cid:48)(cid:48))– has
a lower limit of Trot of 63 K.

The general
picture of the region consists, therefore, of a
very cold and massive IRDC, spotted by tenuous
areas, some
of them depicting moderately high temperatures. This strong
diﬀerence in the
temperatures among the IRDC and the other
positions is even larger if we consider the kinetic
temperatures
(Tk), because the ratio between Tk and Trot increases with Trot
(Danby et al. 1988;
Tafalla et al. 2004). At the IRDC, Tk is in
the range 8 − 12 K, while the positions having yellow
labels may
have Tk between 25 and 47 K. It is hard to constrain Tk in the hot
spots, although large
values, 100 K or even more, are possible.

4.3. Opacities in the IRDC

Fig. 7 depicts the opacities
of the main group (τm in the ap-
pendix), derived when the hf ﬁtting is possible. The positions
correspond to the IRDC, and are labelled in blue, as in Fig. 6. Po-
sitions having two opacities
correspond to those cases with two
velocity components. As expected in the case of dark clouds, the
larger opacities are found toward the inner part of the IRDC. A
notable exception is found in the SW
region, where the opac-
ity remains high in the northern edge of the region, close to the
border of
the ring nebula.

4.4. Column densities and abundances

Fig. 8 depicts the distribution of the
column density, N(NH3),
in the observed ﬁeld. The colour code is the same as in Fig. 6.
The
estimates of N(NH3) in those hot spots (red labels) where
only lower limits to Trot are determined,
was done by assum-

western part of the ﬁeld.
Two positions (the NH3 and the CO peaks) have been observed, indi-
cated
above the boxes. The (1,1) and (2,2) spectra towards the same
positions are also plotted for
comparison. Note that the (1,1) intensity
scale is reduced by a factor of two, and the (3,3) spectra
are multiplied
by 20. The (3,3) spectrum towards the CO peak has been smoothed to
0.7 km s−1. Dashed
vertical lines are plotted at +0.3 and +1.9 km s−1 to
facilitate further comparisons among the
lines, and to separate the three
components present in the (3,3) line towards the NH3 peak.

are 1.8
and 2.8, respectively. Therefore, the absence of emission
in the (3,3) towards the CO peak is
statistically signiﬁcant.

A second feature in Fig. 5 is the presence of three velocity
components
in the (3,3) line towards the NH3 peak. The velocity
of the central component, roughly between the
velocity marks,
agrees with those of the (1,1) and (2,2) lines. However, the lower
(blue) and higher
(red) velocity components of the (3,3) line do
not have any counterpart in the (1,1) or (2,2) line
emission. As
we analyse below, the blue and red components are characterized
by higher temperatures
than the central component.

4. Analysis of the NH3 emission

4.1. Derivation of physical parameters
Ammonia is a rather ubiquitous molecule. Heavily destroyed
in the presence of UV ﬁelds (e. g. Fuente
et al. 1990, and ref-
erences therein), it is present in cold dark clouds (Jijina et al.
1999;
Sepúlveda et al. 2011) and also in regions aﬀected by
shocks (Tafalla & Bachiller 1995; Zhang et al.
2002; Palau et al.
2007). Since the very beginnings of molecular spectroscopy,
it has been largely
recognized as an excellent thermometer of
the ISM (Ho & Townes 1983; Guesten et al. 1985; Maret et
al.
2009).

From the joint analysis of the (1,1) and (2,2) metastable lines,
we have derived several
physical properties of the NH3 gas. The
details of the formulation are explained in an online
appendix.
This analysis was done at each position with signiﬁcant emission
(> 3σ) in any of the two
lines.

The (1,1) line emission arising from the IRDC is mostly opti-
cally thick, and the opacities
were estimated through a hyperﬁne
(hf) ﬁtting. No satellite lines were detected elsewhere, and only
a Gaussian ﬁtting were done. All the positions with signiﬁcant
emission in the (2,2) line were also
ﬁtted by Gaussian proﬁles.

the rotational temperatures, overlaid to the 8 µm
image of Spitzer. The values derived from hyperﬁne
ﬁtting of the (1,1)
line are labelled in blue; those derived from Gaussian ﬁtting of both
lines are
shown in yellow; red labels correspond to those positions hav-
ing the highest values of Trot (see
text). In all cases, ﬁtting of the (2,2)
has been obtained with a single Gaussian component. The low
tempera-
tures associated with the IRDC, and higher values elsewhere are clearly
revealed.

ﬁne ﬁtting of the (1,1) line was

ing Trot = 50 K; all lower limits to Trot are higher than 50 K
and, therefore, the values of N(NH3) are lower limits in all these
cases. At the positions where we
determined upper limits (yel-
low labels), we assumed Trot = 10 K. In those cases having two
velocity components, the sum of both N(NH3) are depicted.

After looking at the Fig. 8, the
diﬀerences between the IRDC
and the rest of the ﬁeld are outstanding. N(NH3) varies from
several
1014 to some 1016 cm−3 at the IRDC positions, and is in
the range from 1012 to 1013 cm−3 elsewhere.
This ample range of the N(NH3) values also aﬀects the esti-
mates of abundances with respect to H2,
X(NH3). Fig. 9 shows
the X(NH3) distribution in the ﬁeld, with the same colour codes
as previous
ﬁgures. To compute the NH3 abundance, we had to
estimate the H2 column density (N(H2) at all
positions. This is
inferred from the 1.2 mm continuum, considered a dust tracer.
Assumed dust
temperatures were 10 K at the IRDC positions
and 50 K elsewhere (see the appendix for details about
the crite-
ria used.

The lowest values of the abundances, in the range from sev-
eral 10−11 to some
10−9, are spread all along the observed ﬁeld
except in the IRDC, where the abundance grows up to
some
10−8. Interestingly, the abundance in the SW region remains high
at its northern and south-
western borders. This is not the ten-
dency expected in a quiescent clump of a dark cloud like, for
instance, the other clumps of the IRDC.

diagram of the NH3 peak af-

sities of the ﬁtting are shown in

nents as central, blue and red according to their velocity ranges.
As
said above, the (1,1) and (2,2) lines have not been de-
tected in the red or blue velocity
components; in these cases,
upper detection limits (3-sigma) have been computed in the cor-
responding velocity ranges.

The results of the Boltzmann diagram are shown in the last

noted; furthermore, high values appear in the northern and south
edges of the SW region, coinciding
with the position of the ﬁrst and
second infrared rings, respectively (see text).

for the central component. For the others, we only derived lower
limits of Trot. As we
also considered the column densities up
to the ﬁrst four metastable levels (see Appendix), the
resultant
values of N(NH3) are therefore upper limits.

Most of the gas (of the order of 1015 cm−2)
arises in the cen-
tral component and has a low value of Trot (11 K); these values
of Trot and
N(NH3) are those typically measured in the IRDC.

But strikingly, there is much low amount of gas
(three or-
ders of magnitude lower) at higher temperatures, above 28 K and
40 K. This ﬁnding conﬁrms
the scenario depicted by the (1,1)
and (2,2) lines in the whole ﬁeld: most of the dense gas is in
cold
form and associated with the IRDC, which in turn is embedded
in a ﬁeld dotted by low amounts of
warm/hot gas.

4.6. Anomalous NH3(1,1) spectra in the SW region

We found anomalous satellite ratios
in the NH3(1,1) spectra at
four positions of the SW region. Figure 11 shows the spectra, to-
gether
with their locations. The positions aﬀected by this anoma-
lous emission lie at the outer edges of
the SW region, two of
them close to the CO peak.

The blue outer satellite hyperﬁne components are
stronger
than those of the red side. This has been proposed to be a sign-

umn densities have been computed for the three
velocity components

component, while for the others (blue

post of contracting motions, both theoretically (Park
2001) and
observationally (e. g. Fontani et al. 2012).

Alternatively, the anomaly could be due to
non-LTE emis-
sion due to hyperﬁne selective photon trapping, as this aﬀects
only the outer
satellites. However, this eﬀect would produce the
opposite result; the red satellite would become
stronger than the
blue one (Stutzki & Winnewisser 1985).

5. Discussion

5.1. Critical revision of
the distances

The most recent distance estimate to some star-forming regions
of Cygnus X is 1.4
kpc, based on spectroscopic parallaxes of
their maser-emitting regions (Rygl et al. 2012). This
distance
is only slightly smaller than previous estimates using the same
technique (Torres-Dodgen et
al. 1991), and consistent with other
works based on stellar classiﬁcation (e. g. Hanson 2003). On
the other hand, several studies locate DR15 at a lower distance,
about 700-800 pc (Wendker et al.
1991; Uyanıker et al. 2001;
Redman et al. 2003).

However, the distance to the IRDC is still a
matter of de-
bate, with distances ranging from 800 to 1700 pc (Redman et al.
2003; Kraemer et al.
2010). A close inspection of the infrared
images and submillimeter continuum emission of a large
ﬁeld of
view (20(cid:48) × 20(cid:48)) including G79.29+0.46 reveals that the IRDC is
interrupted in
two positions: the SW region (e. g. Kraemer et al.
2010; Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010; Umana et al.
2011), and the
position of DR15 (see Fig. 2 of Redman et al. 2003). At ﬁrst
sight, the IRDC is
farther away than both DR15 and the LBV
nebula. However, the presence of a dark ﬁlamentary structure
extending to the north of the IRDC and crossing the LBV neb-
ula up to the position of the LBV star
suggests that part of the
IRDC is also in front of the LBV nebula (Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 11).
Therefore, provided that part of the IRDC seems to be in front
of the LBV nebula, and part of it
seems to be behind, it seems

reasonable to consider that the IRDC and the LBV nebula lie at
similar distances, of 1.4
kpc.

In addition, the overall NH3 (1,1) and 1.2 mm emission
shown in Fig. 1 reveal a discontinuity
separating the SW region
and the westernmost clump of the IRDC, which is coincident
with a bright 8
µm structure extending from the infrared ring
farther to the south-west (Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 11).
This has been
proposed as an interaction zone of the LBV star with the sur-
rounding medium (Umana
et al. 2011) and favours the associa-
tion of the LBV star with the IRDC.

The ﬁnding of hot spots
with low column density in the
ﬁeld of view toward G79.29+0.46 leads us to associate the
most
tenuous ammonia to the Cygnus X star-forming region, or
even to G79.29+0.46 itself. In this
scenario, the warm/hot spots
may represent the relics of the clumps of the ancient molecular
cloud,
which are being photo-evaporated by the UV ﬁeld from
G79.29+0.46, perhaps supported by other
neighbouring massive
stars. This idea is reinforced by the low abundance of NH3 mea-
sured near
G79.29+0.46, compatible with the idea of NH3 being
photo-dissociated by the strong UV radiation
present in the re-
gion. The high temperatures found in the nebula are consistent
with the high dust
temperature already found in the same region
(Waters et al. 1996; Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010).

In
summary, we are providing here suﬃcient arguments
which favour the possibility of some co-existence
of the IRDC
and G79.29+0.46 in close volumes. Therefore, the interplay be-
tween these two objects
should be explored in more detail.

5.2. Hints of a possible interaction in the SW region

As said
above, the fraction of the IRDC which we mapped is
roughly divided in four regions, more or less
aligned from the
south-east corner of the map to its western border. In some as-
pects, the SW
region (one of these four regions) presents a num-
ber of peculiarities as compared to the other
three regions.

Article number, page 8 of 15

The opacities measured in the SW region do not clearly
de-
crease at the borders, which is not the expected behaviour in a
typical cold dark cloud. In
particular, the opacity in the north-
ern edge –roughly a strip from (0”, −120”) to (−80”, −100”)–
remains as high as in the centre. The abundance is also high
in some points of the same strip, up to
one order of magnitude
larger compared to the NH3 peak (located at the centre of the
SW region). The
southern border –a strip from (−30”, −200”) to
(−120”, −150”)– also depicts some points of high
relative abun-
dance. The anomalous (1,1) satellite emission (Sect. 4.6) in the
external parts of
the SW region is also another peculiarity.

The large diﬀerences in some parameters of the SW
region,
in comparison to the rest of the IRDC, should be due to diﬀer-
ent physical conditions. An
increase of the abundances towards
the borders is not the expected tendency in the parts of a cold
cloud most exposed to external UV radiation. The abundance
of NH3 in a harsh environment may be
enhanced by sputtering
in the presence of a C-type shock (Flower & Pineau des Forêts
1994; Draine
1995), which releases volatile molecules from the
surface of the dust grains. This is a reasonable
hypothesis tak-
ing into account the presence of a low-velocity shock (about
14 km s−1) at the
north-western side of the SW region, close
to the CO peak (Rizzo et al. 2008). It is also worth
noting that
the northern edge of the SW region coincides with a brightening
and morphological
disturbance of the 6-cm continuum emission,
which is claimed as an evidence of some interaction with
the
surrounding ISM (Umana et al. 2011). Therefore, these ammo-
nia observations may have unveiled
the molecular counterpart of
such disturbance, and also a new molecular component associ-
ated with
the shocks discovered in CO (Rizzo et al. 2008).

The positions of abundance enhancement towards the
south-
ern border of the SW region agree with those of the external in-
frared shell, better seen in
24 µm (Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010,
and Fig. 9 of this work).

Rizzo et al.: NH3 associated with
G79.29+0.46

The scenario of the LBV star interacting with the IRDC is
also consistent with the
(3,3) spectrum towards NH3 peak, which
reveals two velocity components tracing gas at temperatures
(cid:38)
30 K, clearly larger than the typical temperatures measured in
the IRDC, of ∼ 10 K.
Therefore, a number of observational ﬁndings points to a
possible interaction of the nebula and the
nested molecular shells
with the SW region. A deﬁnitive evidence will come from obser-
vations with
high angular resolution.

5.3. Triggered star formation in the SW region

If the LBV star is
interacting with the SW region this could af-
fect the star formation which is currently ongoing in
the area
(Vink et al. 2008). The dynamical time scale of the ejection
events which produced the CO
and infrared nested shells is 104–
105 yr (Rizzo et al. 2008; Umana et al. 2011). This is compara-
ble to the age of the brightest young stellar object embedded in
the SW region, assuming it is in
the Class 0 phase (Greene et al.
1994; Kenyon & Hartmann 1995; Enoch et al. 2009; Evans et al.
2009). Thus, while it seems unlikely that the ejection events of
the LBV could have triggered the
collapse of the young stel-
lar objects embedded in the SW region, an interesting possibility
would
be to explore whether they are aﬀecting the formation and
evolution of the young stellar objects
already formed.

surrounding gas

After some 104 − 105 yr of evolution, G79.29+0.46
will
become a Wolf-Rayet star and the NH3
ring will even-
tually disappear. The stellar wind regime
will change at
this stage,
to higher velocity and lower
wind density (Langer et al. 1994; Maeder &
Meynet 1994;
Garcia-Segura & Mac Low 1995). This will produce new
and dust, which may
shocks
release
volatile molecules
icy grain mantles
(Flower & Pineau des Forêts 1994) and consequently increase
the
ammonia abundance again. This line of reasoning is sup-
ported by the signiﬁcantly high NH3
abundance seen to the
north and south-western borders of the SW region, a trend also
found in the
molecular cloud around the WR nebula NGC 2359
(Rizzo et al. 2001a), and the Galactic Center (Flower
et al. 1995;
Martín-Pintado et al. 1999). The young stellar objects formed in
the SW region will
probably suﬀer photo-evaporation and heat-
ing of their envelopes.

6. Conclusions
In order to study the molecular gas in the infrared ring nebula of
the LBV star G79.29+0.46 and its
nearby IRDC, we used the Ef-
felsberg telescope to map the NH3 (1,1) and NH3(2,2) emission
in the
G79.29+0.46 ﬁeld. We additionally observed NH3(3,3)
in particular positions of the strongest
NH3(1,1) emission. Our
main ﬁndings are summarized as follows:

1. While the strongest emission of
NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) matches
the infrared-dark structure of the IRDC, mainly detected at
velocities >
1 km s−1, the emission in the velocity range
from −1.2 km s−1 to +0.5 km s−1 reveals a coherent
structure
closely following the infrared ring surrounding the LBV star,
also partially seen in the
(2,2) transition. This is the ﬁrst NH3
structure associated with an evolved massive star known so
far.

2. We derived the rotational temperature and NH3 column den-
sity of the dense gas in the
entire ﬁeld of view, and found that
the rotational temperature is uniform and in the range 7–11 K
in
the IRDC, while it is > 30 K in particular positions or hot

spots of the infrared ring nebula and a
couple of points within
30(cid:48)(cid:48) of the LBV star. The NH3 column density in the IRDC is
in
the range 1014–1015 cm−2, while it is about two orders of
magnitude lower near the LBV and the
infrared ring. Using
the 1.2 mm continuum emission in the ﬁeld, we inferred NH3
abundances of about
10−8 in the IRDC, and 10−10–10−9 near
the LBV star. The warm temperatures and low abundances
of NH3
near the LBV star and its infrared-ring suggest that
the gas is being heated and photo-dissociated
by the intense
UV-ﬁeld of the LBV star.

3. An outstanding region is recognized beyond the ring neb-
ula towards its south-western part, which is also part of the
IRDC (the SW region). The NH3 (3,3)
emission towards the
centre of the SW region reveals three velocity components.
One of them is
associated with the IRDC and has a rotational
temperature of 11 K, while the other two are
associated with
small dense cores with temperatures > 30 K. In the northern
edge of the SW region,
the opacity of the (1,1) line keeps
a value as high as in the clump centre. The NH3 abundance
tends
to be higher at the clump edges than in the clump cen-
tre. All these features, together with the
results of previous
works reporting a shock within this region and hints of inter-
action with the
LBV star, strongly suggests that a mass-loss
ejection event of the LBV star is interacting with the
SW re-
gion and releasing NH3 molecules back to the gas phase, thus
increasing its abundance at the
outer edges of the clump.

G79.29+0.46 is providing increasing evidences of being an
excellent
laboratory to study the history of a high-mass star evo-
lution. Being LBVs the precursors of core-
collapse supernovae
(through a Wolf-Rayet stage), the knowledge of the diﬀerent ac-
tors present in
this ﬁeld may also help to learn about this topic.
The ammonia ring-like structure associated to
G79.29+0.46 and
the SW region deserve follow up observations with high angu-
lar resolution.
Furthermore, the observation of other molecular
tracers would be of particular interest.

Appendix B: Formulation

Appendix B.1: Hyperﬁne and
Gaussian ﬁtting

A&A proofs: manuscript no. g79-nh3-v3-astroph

The NH3 lines are splitted by the
quadrupole hyperﬁne interac-
tion (Ho & Townes 1983). From the relative intensities of the
main hf
group and the four satellite ones, it is possible to di-
rectly derive the optical depth of the main
hf group (Pauls et al.
1983). When the satellite (1,1) lines are detected, a CLASS
method was used
for this ﬁtting. The output are: (1) A τm =
f [Jν(Texc) − Jν(Tbg)] τm; (2) LSR velocity (VLSR); (3)
line width
at half maximum (∆v); and (4) τm, the opacity of the main
hf group. f is the beam ﬁlling
factor, and Jν(T ) is Rayleigh-
Jeans temperature, deﬁned as Jν(T ) = (h ν/k) (eh ν/k T − 1)−1,
Tbg
= 2.73 K is the background temperature, and h and k are the
Planck and Boltzmann constants,
respectively.

This formulation assumes that all the hf levels are populated
according to local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions,
and a Gaussian velocity distribution. The level
population is
characterized by the excitation temperature Texc, which can be
cleared from the ﬁtting
by:

Texc =

hν/k
ln[1 + hν/k W −1]

,

(B.1)

where W = Jν(Texc) = A/ f + Jν(Tbg).

The column
density of a NH3 (J, K) level, N(J, K), is ob-

tained by:

N(J, K) = 1.65 1014

ν

J(J + 1)
K2

∆v
Texc τtot cm−2 ,

(B.2)

where ν is the line frequency in GHz, τtot is the “total” opacity
of all
the hf components, and ∆v and Texc are in km s−1 and K,
respectively. The above equation results
from solving the Trans-
port Equation for the NH3 molecule (Wilson et al. 2009), using
a dipole
moment µ = 1.469 D, and assuming Texc >> Tbg.

When the hyperﬁne ﬁtting is possible, we estimate the
col-
umn density of the (1,1) level, N(1,1), using the above equation.
Numerically, it is computed
by:

N(1, 1) = 2.785 1013 ∆v Texc τm cm−2 ,
where a rough assumption of τtot = 2 τm is used.

(B.3)
When the hyperﬁne ﬁtting is not possible, we have assumed
optically thin emission. In this case, Eq.
(B.2) for the (1,1) line
turns out to:

N(1, 1) = 1.308 1013

(cid:90)

TMB dv cm −2 .

(B.4)

In
the above equation, all the hf components are included in
the integral. If the integration extends
only to the main group,
the coeﬃcient should then be multiplied by a factor of 2.

In the case of
the (2,2) line, the equivalent expression is:

N(2, 2) = 9.801 1012

(cid:90)

TMB dv cm −2 .

(B.5)
Provided N(1, 1) and N(2, 2), the rotational temperature Trot
can be computed (Townes & Schawlow
1975; Ho & Townes
1983) by:

Trot =

−41.5

(B.6)

In
this appendix we summarize the formula used for the de-
termination of some physical properties
(opacities, rotational
temperatures, column densities, and abundances) from the ob-
served NH3
lines. This corresponds to the standard interpreta-
tion already discussed and presented by several
authors, such as
Ungerechts et al. (1986) and Busquet et al. (2009).

from a

two-level
system approximation

The partition function is given by

between the values usually adopted for
pre-stellar dense clumps
and circumstellar envelopes in young stellar objects of class II
(Motte et
al. 2007).

Under these assumptions, the resulting formula is

Q(T ) = (cid:80)

≈ 1 + 3 e−23.4/T + 5 e−64.9/T + 14 e−124.8/T ,

(cid:19)−1

(cid:18)
Tdust

cm−2 ,

(B.12)

where gJK = (2J + 1) gop and EJK are the statistical weight and
the
energy of the level (J, K), and gop is the statistical weight for
the ortho and para species. In the
above equation we summed up
to the ﬁrst four levels 3 , and assumed that (1) only the metastable
levels are populated; (2) the levels are characterized by the LTE
temperature T; and (3) gop equals
to 2 and 1 for the ortho and
para species, respectively.

The total column density of all the
metastable lines may
be computed from a single line and by assuming a partition
function
characterized by T = Trot(e. g. Ungerechts et al. 1986;
Busquet et al. 2009):

N(NH3) = (N(J,
K)/gJK) Q(Trot) eEJK /kTrot .

(B.8)

In particular, for the (1,1) line the above equation becomes
N(NH3) = N(1, 1)

(cid:34)

(cid:35)

.
(B.9)

When the (2,2) line is the only one detected, an equivalent

formula to (B.9) is:

where S is
the ﬂux at 1.2 mm in the convolved map. Tdust is as-
sumed as 10 K in the IRDC positions, and 50 K
elsewhere, con-
sistent with the two dust population previously reported in the
region (Umana et al.
2011).

For the IRDC, the assumed value of 10 K is compatible
with the Trot derived from the hf
ﬁtting, because Tk≈Trot at low
temperatures, and the gas is thermalised at the dust tempera-
ture.
At the other positions –particularly in the ring nebula and
its interior– the continuum emission is
bright at shorter wave-
lengths, such as 24 µm, indicating a dust temperature probably
larger. By
assuming a conservative value of 50 K the derived
values of N(H2) have to be considered as upper
limits and thus
X(NH3) as lower limits.

Appendix B.3: Rotational diagrams

The rotational diagram,
also known as the Boltzmann diagram
approach, is a rather common methodology used to derive the
rotational temperature and column density of a given species.
The method is described in many works
(see, for example,
Goldsmith & Langer 1999) and assumes a population of the lev-
els characterized
by Trot, under LTE conditions.

By taking logarithms to Eq. B.8, and after some algebra, we

obtain:
N(NH3) = N(2, 2)

(B.10)

Appendix B.2: Abundances

The NH3 abundance is computed by

X(NH3) = N(NH3)/N(H2) ,

(B.11)

where
N(H2) is the H2 column density. To estimate it, we used
the survey of the Cygnus region done by
Motte et al. (2007) in
the 1.2 mm continuum emission.

At this wavelength, most of the ﬂux arises
from thermal dust
emission, which is optically thin. By assuming a constant gas-
to-dust ratio, the
1.2 mm ﬂux results directly related to the total
gas. We therefore used the formulation of Motte et
al. (1998),
accordingly adapted to our case.

More precisely, we have used their Eq. (1’), which
compute
N(H2) as a function of the 1.2 mm ﬂux, the dust temperature
(Tdust) and κ1.2mm, the dust
opacity per unit mass column density.
The map of Motte et al. (2007) was convolved to
40(cid:48)(cid:48)
in order to match the 100m’s angular resolution. For κ1.2mm
we have adopted a
value of 0.01 g−1 (cm−2)−1, which corre-
sponds to the case of dust particles covered by thin ice
mantles
(Ossenkopf & Henning 1994), and is also a geometrical average

3 The error introduced by
this simpliﬁcation is lower than 8 10−7 %,
1.3 %, 3 %, and 17 % for Tk = 10 K, 20 K, 50 K, and 100
K.

We see in the above equation that the energy of the upper
levels are
linearly related to the logarithms of the column densi-
ties.

If three or more lines of a given
species are measured, we
can deﬁne the abscissa x as (EJK/k), and the ordinate y as
log (cid:2)N(J,
K)/gJK
(cid:3). x and y are related by the usual linear equation
y = a x + b, and we can therefore
ﬁnd the least square regression
line. Trot and N(NH3) can be obtained from the slope a and the
constant term b by:

Trot = − log e/a

and

N(NH3) = 10b Q(Trot) .

ABSTRACT
Context. The surroundings of Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars are excellent laboratories
to study the e ects of their high UV
radiation, powerful winds, and strong ejection events onto the
surrounding gas and dust.
Aims. We aim at determining the physical parameters of the dense gas near
G79.29 +0.46, an LBV-candidate located at the centre of
two concentric infrared rings which may
interact with the infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G79.3 +0.3.
Methods. The E elsberg 100 m telescope was
used to observe the NH 3(1,1), (2,2) emission in a ﬁeld of view of 7070including the
infrared rings
and a part of the IRDC. In addition, we observed particular positions in the NH 3(3,3) transition
toward the strongest
region of the IRDC, which is also closest to the ring nebula.
Results. We
report here the ﬁrst coherent ring-like structure of dense NH 3gas associated with an evolved
massive star. It is well traced
in both ammonia lines, surrounding an already known infrared ring
nebula; its column density is two orders of magnitude lower than
the IRDC. The NH 3emission in the
IRDC is characterized by a low and uniform rotational temperature ( Trot10 K) and moderately
high
opacities in the (1,1) line. The rest of the observed ﬁeld is spotted by warm or hot zones ( Trot>30
K) and characterized by
optically thin emission of the (1,1) line. The NH 3abundances are about
10 8in the IRDC, and 10 10–10 9elsewhere. The warm
temperatures and low abundances of NH 3in the
ring suggest that the gas is being heated and photo-dissociated by the intense UV
ﬁeld of the LBV
star. An outstanding region is found to the south-west (SW) of the LBV star within the IRDC. The NH
3(3,3)
emission at the centre of the SW region reveals two velocity components tracing gas at
temperatures >30 K. Of particular interest
is the northern edge of the SW region, which coincides
with the border of the ring nebula and a region of strong 6 cm continuum
emission; here, the opacity
of the (1,1) line and the NH 3abundance do not decrease as expected in a typical clump of an
isolated
cold dark cloud. This strongly suggests some kind of interaction between the ring nebula
(powered by the LBV star) and the IRDC.
We ﬁnally discuss the possibility of NH 3evaporation from
the dust grain mantles due to the already known presence of low-velocity
shocks in the area.
Conclusions. The detection of the NH 3associated with this LBV ring nebula, as well as the special
characteristics of the northern
border of the SW region, conﬁrm that the surroundings of G79.29
+0.46 constitutes an exemplary scenario, which is worth to be
studied in detail by other molecular
tracers and higher angular resolutions.

1. Introduction
Massive stars are probably the most important sources provid-
ing thermal
and mechanical energy to the interstellar medium
(ISM). They are few in number and remain on the
Main Se-
quence during some million years only. One of the shortest (up
to a few 104yr) and most
spectacular stages of their evolution is
reached when they become luminous blue variable (LBV)
stars.
With bolometric luminosities >3105L, LBV stars are charac-
terized by their heavy mass loss
and both photometric and spec-
troscopic variability, and are supposed to be the progenitors of
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars (Langer et al. 1994; Maeder & Meynet
1994) or, as suggested by other authors,
even the direct progeni-
tors of type II supernovae with dense circumstellar material (e. g.
Gal-Yam
et al. 2007; Smith 2007). A key subject of current study
about the LBV stars is the mechanism which
drives the vari-ability and episodic mass ejections. Since the winds and mass
ejections leave their
ﬁngerprints on the surrounding material, the
study of the distribution, composition and physical
properties of
the circumstellar gas and dust would put constraints on the stellar
wind models (e. g.
Garcia-Segura & Mac Low 1995).
This circumstellar material, at up to 1 pc distance from the
star,
has been traditionally studied in the optical /IR, tracing emis-
sion nebulae consisting of ionized
and neutral atomic gas and the
(often) warm dust. However, the LBV environment is presum-
ably also
rich in molecules, (1) because the stars are active dust
producers and (2) because there should be
shocks, caused by the
stellar wind, triggering a shock induced chemistry. In addition,
since the
atmospheric abundances of LBVs are expected to be
He-enriched and near nuclear-CNO equilibrium, it
is theoreti-
cally expected that the ejecta from LBVs will be rich in nitro-
genated species (e. g.
Smith et al. 1998, and references therein).

A clear-cut case of an environment rich in molecules
is
NGC 2359. In this WR nebula, Rizzo et al. (2001a) have de-
tected the NH 3(1,1) and (2,2)
metastable lines, which was the
ﬁrst detection of a polyatomic molecule in the surroundings of
an
evolved massive star. NH 3was detected towards a peak of the
CO emission (Rizzo et al. 2001b,
2003a), in coincidence with
other complex molecules (such as HCO+, CS, CN, and HCN;
see Rizzo et al.
2003b). These ﬁndings revealed the presence
of dense and warm molecular gas, which can be traced by
N-
bearing molecules. The high ammonia abundance and kinetic
temperature derived (10 8and 30 K,
respectively) are interpreted
in terms of a shock-induced chemistry. The same molecules de-
tected
in NGC 2359 (and some isotopomers) were later reported
in the Homunculus, the circumstellar nebula
around the well
known LBV Carina (Smith et al. 2006; Loinard et al. 2012).
Among the N-bearing
molecules usually studied, NH 3is par-
ticularly interesting due to its relatively high abundance
and
ubiquity. Moreover, its properties allow an accurate determina-
tion of the kinetic temperature,
avoiding usual observational is-
sues like calibration and pointing (Ho & Townes 1983). The de-
tection of NH 3in the environment of NGC 2359 and Carina
encourages studies of additional LBV star
environments.
The nebula G79.29 +0.46 constitutes an excellent testbed to
pursue this kind of
studies. The combined e ect of the high
UV ﬁeld, the steady powerful winds and the violent mass
ejec-
tions have produced conspicuous structures in the nebula and
beyond. G79.29 +0.46, ﬁrstly
discovered by its free-free emis-
sion (Higgs et al. 1994), is a ring-like nebula formed and excited
by a LBV candidate, surrounded by an outstanding pair of con-
centric rings seen in the infrared up
to 24 m (see Fig. 1 of
Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010), which is likely formed by mate-
rial ejected
by the central object in at least two di erent mass-
loss episodes. The detection of a CO structure
around the neb-
ula, as observed in the J=2!1 and J=3!2 lines
(Rizzo et al. 2008), demonstrated the
existence of warm and /or
high-density molecular gas. Immersed within the CO structure,
there is a
higher density clump which is claimed to be associated
with the south-western side of the infrared
nebula. This work
also provided evidences for a low-velocity shock with veloci-
ties around 14–15 km
s 1toward this CO clump. Subsequent
COJ=4!3 emission (Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010) revealed
two
concentric slabs in the same region of the clump, ﬁlling the
space between the two shells detected
at 24 m, and in coinci-
dence with a brightening of the 6 cm continuum emission of the
nebula
(Umana et al. 2011).
G79.29 +0.46 is part of the very complex Cygnus X region. It
is projected in
between two star-forming regions: the H iiregion
DR 15 to the south-east (see Fig. 11 of Kraemer et
al. 2010),
and the infrared dark cloud IRDC G79.3 +0.3 (hereafter the
IRDC) towards the southern and
western borders (Redman et al.
2003). The local arm is seen tangentially in this direction
(Dame &
Thaddeus 1985; Rygl et al. 2012), which makes it dif-
ﬁcult to determine distances and to identify
mutual associations
among targets associated with the Cyg X region. An update of
the information
currently available and a brief discussion of the
distance is presented below, in Sect. 5.1.
In this
paper, we present NH 3(1,1) and (2,2) maps observed
with the E elsberg 100-m radio telescope
towards the LBV neb-
ula G79.29 +0.46 and the nearby IRDC. In Sect. 2 we describe
the observations.
In Sect. 3 we present the structure of ammo-
nia emission in di erent velocity ranges, revealing a
ring-like
structure associated with the previously known infrared shell, as
well as spectra of NH
3(3,3) towards two positions in the south-
western region. In Section 4 we analyse the ammonia data
in theﬁeld, and study the properties of the dense gas associated with
the LBV nebula and with the
IRDC. Finally, in Sect. 5, we dis-
cuss the most relevant properties of the dense gas in the region,
and the possible interaction of the LBV nebula with the IRDC.
The main conclusions are summarized in
Sect. 6.
2. Observations
We have used the E elsberg 100-m radio telescope of the Max-
Planck-
Institut für Radioastronomie to map the distribution of
the (1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines of NH 3,
in a7070ﬁeld
around G79.29 +0.46. The observations have been carried out in
March 2008.
The 1.3 cm
HEMT receiver was tuned to 23.7086 GHz, a
frequency lying midway between the rest frequencies of the
two
observed lines. We have used the FFTS spectrometer, which pro-
vides a bandwidth of 100 MHz and
a frequency resolution of
6 kHz (0.08 km s 1). This spectrometer allowed the simulta-
neous
observation of the two lines, with excellent velocity res-
olution. The whole data processing was
done using the CLASS
software1. After baseline subtraction and calibration, the spectra
have been
smoothed to a resolution of 0.24 km s 1for further
analysis.
The telescope beam size (half power
beam width, HPBW) at
the observed frequency is 4000, and the main beam e ciency
is 0.52. We have
used NGC 7027 for continuum calibration, as-
suming an absolute ﬂux of 5.58 Jy at 23.7 GHz (Ott et
al. 1994).
We have also used DR21 (close to the observed ﬁeld) as a line
calibrator. Pointing was
regularly checked, typically once every
hour, and is accurate to within 700.
We have done all the
observations in position switching
mode, with the relative reference position at 20000in azimuth.
Integration times per point varied between 5 and 10 minutes on-
source, depending on weather
conditions and elevations. Due to
variable weather the system temperature varied between 30 K
and 94
K, resulting in a rmsnoise (1-sigma) between 50 mK and
350 mK for a velocity spacing of 0.24 km s 1.
All temperatures
throughout this paper are on a main-beam scale ( TMB).
The whole ﬁeld was initially
sampled every 4000. A particular
region of interest, corresponding to a multiple layered morphol-
ogy in CO (Rizzo et al. 2008) has been fully sampled (i. e. every
2000); this region is indicated in
Figs. 1 to 4 by a square and is
referred to as "the SW region" hereafter.
Furthermore, two deep-
integration pointed observations of
the (3,3) line were done towards speciﬁc positions. These posi-
tions correspond to NH 3and CO peaks, as explained in Sect. 3.3.
Identical technical conditions were
applied in this case.
All the positions throughout this paper are o sets from the
equatorial
coordinates (J2000.0) of the exciting star, at (RA,
Dec.) =(20h31m42s:29;+402105900:1).
3. Results
3.1. Overall emission
The whole velocity range of NH 3emission, from 3 km s 1
to+3 km s 1, falls
within the corresponding to Cyg X and
the Great Rift regions (Schneider et al. 2006; Gottschalk et
al.
2012). Channel maps of the emission of the (1,1) and (2,2)
lines are presented in an online
appendix, and the spectra are
also accessible for download at CDS. The velocity-integrated

Fig. 1. NH 3(1,1) line intensity map in direction to
G79.29 +0.46. Only
the main component has been integrated, in the velocity range indi-
cated at the
top right corner. On grayscale, the 1.2 mm continuum im-
age of the MAMBO cameras at the IRAM 30 m
telescope is also plotted
(Motte et al. 2007). The logarithmic intensity scale used is indicated in
the top bar. NH 3starting contours and spacing are 0.2 K km s 1. Equa-
torial coordinates are
referred to the star position (Sect. 2). The region
was fully sampled within the square indicated at
the south west, and
every 4000elsewhere. The white contour, taken from the MAMBO data,
is plotted to
indicate the boundaries of the IRDC. Most of the NH 3(1,1)
emission seems associated with the cold
dust traced by the 1.2 mm con-
tinuum, although some low-level features are also noted (see text).
maps of both lines, in the interval (  3;+3) km s 1, are shown
in Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 1, the
(1,1) contours are superim-
posed on the 1.2 mm continuum image from the MAMBO and
MAMBO-2 cameras
at the IRAM 30 m telescope (Motte et al.
2007), smoothed to an angular resolution of 2600. The
ﬁgure
shows that the most intense NH 3and 1.2 mm emission arises
from the IRDC, extending from the
south-east to the west of our
ﬁeld of view, and consisting of four main clumps. The peaks of
ammonia
do not agree with those of the 1.2 mm continuum. The
SW region (the area inside the square) is the
closest in projec-
tion to the ring of ionized nebula (Higgs et al. 1994; Umana et al.
2011). It is
worth noting that while the southern clump and the
SW region are physically connected, the
connection between the
SW region and the western clump su ers a discontinuity both in
dust and gas,
even taking into account that their overall structure
suggests they are part of the same large-scale
cloud. There is also
some weak emission, traced by the low-level contours; this low-
level emission
is particularly visible at the northern and western
part of the ﬁeld, and also close to its centre,
near the LBV star.
The NH 3(2,2) line emission shares some of the (1,1) fea-
tures. Fig. 2 plots the
NH 3(2,2) emission in the same velocity
range as in Fig. 1. Again, the most extended emission
appears
correlated to the 1.2 mm continuum, and consequently to the
IRDC; furthermore, some emission
at the centre and the west
is also present. It is notable that the peak of the whole map arises
Fig.
2. The same as Fig. 1 for the NH 3(2,2) line. Contours start at
0.22 K km s 1, and are spaced by
0.11 K km s 1. Although the most
extended emission is well correlated to the dark cloud in the south
and
west, the peak of the (2,2) line arises from the (000; 4000) position and
is not correlated to
the 1.2 mm emission.
from a position close to the LBV star, at (000; 4000). The central
part of the
ﬁeld is devoid of NH 3(2,2) emission, except at the
(000; 4000) position.
3.2. NH 3associated with
the LBV nebula
In order to identify and further characterize the ammonia asso-
ciated with G79.29
+0.46, we have thoroughly studied the NH 3
emission in di erent velocity bins. After this analysis,
two ve-
locity ranges are particularly interesting. In Figs. 3 and 4, the
emission of the (1,1) and
(2,2) lines are sketched in such veloc-
ity intervals.
Figure 3 shows the ammonia emission in the
velocity range
( 1:2;+0:5) km s 1, overlaid to a Herschel /PACS image at
70m2. An outstanding
morphological correlation with the ring
nebula (especially in the (1,1) line) is noted in this
ﬁgure, where
a large fraction of the 70 m ring is surrounded by an ammonia
feature. This NH 3ring-
like structure bounds the 70 m ring to
the north and west, but is projected above it towards the
south.
The (2,2) line also shows a similar morphology, although not as
clear as the (1,1) line. The
lowest-level contours of the (1,1) and
(2,2) lines corresponds to a signal-to-noise (S /N) ratio
greater
than 4 and 1.5, respectively, which explains the lack of a better
correlation in the (2,2)
line.
Moreover, the inner part of the nebula is also partially ﬁlled
by (1,1) emission, without a
(2,2) counterpart. Due to the under-
sampling and the limited S /N ratio, it is not possible to
deter-
mine whether a physical connection between the ammonia ring
and the emission at the ﬁeld
centre exists. If so, most of the NH 3

Fig. 3. NH 3(1,1) and (2,2) integrated line emission
in the velocity
range ( 1:2;+0:5) km s 1, overlaid on the 70 m continuum of Her-
schel/PACS. The
white contour is the same depicted in Figs. 1 and 2.
The fully sample area is indicated by the white
square. The white trian-
gle (circle) points to the position of the NH 3(CO) peak. NH 3(1,1) start-
ing and spacing contours (yellow) are 0.12 and 0.06 K km s 1, respec-
tively. NH 3(2,2) starting and
spacing contours (blue) are 0.04 K km s 1.
In this velocity range, the ammonia emission is dominated
by a ring-like
structure towards the outer part of the ring nebula (see text).
associated with the
LBV nebula could be the surviving of a for-
merly complete NH 3shell.
Figure 4 is similar to Fig. 3,
but covers the second velocity
range of interest: ( +0:5;+1:2) km s 1. Here, the NH 3emission of
both lines is concentrated towards the SW region, approximately
at the centre of the fully sampled
area. The (2,2) line emission
also depicts a strong spot around (000; 4000) without a counter-
part
in the (1,1) line.
The velocity of the NH 3ring does not match with the
values reported for the CO
shell (see Figs. 6 and 7 of
Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010), which are around  3 km s 1and
+3 km s 1.
This contradictory result is only apparent, because
it accounts for intrinsic di erences in the
molecules under com-
parison. CO is very abundant and ubiquitous, optically thick and
with a low
critical density; therefore, it is expected the emission
of CO in environments with a wider range of
physical conditions
than NH 3. The velocity of the NH 3ring ﬁts well within the whole
range of
emission associated to the CO shell (  5 to+5 km s 1;
see Rizzo et al. 2008), but is close to the
velocity of the local arm
in this direction, and also the velocity of Cygnus X and the Great
Cygnus
Rift. The velocity ranges of the CO slabs reported by
Jiménez-Esteban et al. (2010) are merely those
where the confu-
sion e ects are minor and a clear correlation with the infrared
shell is noted.
In
projection, the NH 3ring bounds the ring nebula and the
CO slabs, although the presence of any
positional di erences
between CO and NH 3should take into consideration the argu-
ments presented
above, and the fact that the comparison is made
at dierent velocities. As we discuss below, the
lack of ammonia

(+0:5;+1:2) km s 1.
Starting contours and spacing of the NH 3(1,1)
line (yellow) are 0.6 K km s 1and 0.2 K km s 1,
respectively. For the
NH 3(2,2) line, the starting contours and spacing (blue) are 0.09 and
0.03 K
km s 1, respectively. At this velocity range, the ammonia emis-
sion is particularly intense towards
the SW region (e.g., within the white
square), in coincidence with the most prominent CO emission.
Another
outstanding feature is the (2,2) spot around (000; 4000), which has no
(1,1) counterpart.
at
the ring nebula positions is consistent with the destruction of
this molecule by the high UV ﬁeld.
3.3. NH 3(3,3) in the SW region
We devoted a special attention to the SW region, because
it hosts a
multiple layered CO structure (Rizzo et al. 2008;
Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010), and is also claimed
as a site of in-
teraction between the LBV nebula and its environs (Umana et al.
2011).
The CO
(Rizzo et al. 2008; Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010) and
dust-continuum emission (Figs. 1 and 2) are
very well correlated
in this region. Ammonia also depicts a strong and compact emis-
sion in the SW
region, although does not peak at the same po-
sition as CO and dust. Hereafter, we will refer to
the peaks of
emission of ammonia and CO as the “NH 3peak” and the “CO
peak”. The NH 3peak is near
the centre of the SW region, at
( 5400; 13100), while the CO peak is shifted with respect to
the NH
3peak approximately by (  2000;+2000). In order to better
analyse these two points, we have done
deep integrations of the
(3,3) line.
Both (3,3) spectra are presented in Fig. 5, together with the
corresponding (1,1) and (2,2) lines. Dashed velocity marks have
been added at +0:3 and +1:9 km s 1to
facilitate the compar-
isons.
The ﬁrst feature in the ﬁgure is the lack of (3,3) emis-
sion in the
CO peak. The ratio of the areas between the
NH 3peak and the CO peak –computed in the velocity range
(+0:3;+1:9) km s 1of the (3,3) line– is greater than 16. On the
other hand, the same ratios computed
for the (1,1) and (2,2) lines

Fig. 5. NH 3(3,3) observations in the south-western
part of the ﬁeld.
Two positions (the NH 3and the CO peaks) have been observed, indi-
cated above the
boxes. The (1,1) and (2,2) spectra towards the same
positions are also plotted for comparison. Note
that the (1,1) intensity
scale is reduced by a factor of two, and the (3,3) spectra are multiplied
by 20. The (3,3) spectrum towards the CO peak has been smoothed to
0.7 km s 1. Dashed vertical lines
are plotted at +0:3 and +1:9 km s 1to
facilitate further comparisons among the lines, and to
separate the three
components present in the (3,3) line towards the NH 3peak.
are 1.8 and 2.8,
respectively. Therefore, the absence of emission
in the (3,3) towards the CO peak is statistically
signiﬁcant.
A second feature in Fig. 5 is the presence of three velocity
components in the (3,3)
line towards the NH 3peak. The velocity
of the central component, roughly between the velocity
marks,
agrees with those of the (1,1) and (2,2) lines. However, the lower
(blue) and higher (red)
velocity components of the (3,3) line do
not have any counterpart in the (1,1) or (2,2) line
emission. As
we analyse below, the blue and red components are characterized
by higher temperatures
than the central component.
4. Analysis of the NH 3emission
4.1. Derivation of physical parameters
Ammonia is a rather ubiquitous molecule. Heavily destroyed
in the presence of UV ﬁelds (e. g. Fuente
et al. 1990, and ref-
erences therein), it is present in cold dark clouds (Jijina et al.
1999;
Sepúlveda et al. 2011) and also in regions a ected by
shocks (Tafalla & Bachiller 1995; Zhang et
al. 2002; Palau et al.
2007). Since the very beginnings of molecular spectroscopy,
it has been
largely recognized as an excellent thermometer of
the ISM (Ho & Townes 1983; Guesten et al. 1985;
Maret et al.
2009).
From the joint analysis of the (1,1) and (2,2) metastable lines,
we have derived
several physical properties of the NH 3gas. The
details of the formulation are explained in an
online appendix.
This analysis was done at each position with signiﬁcant emission
(>3) in any of
the two lines.
The (1,1) line emission arising from the IRDC is mostly opti-
cally thick, and the
opacities were estimated through a hyperﬁne
(hf) ﬁtting. No satellite lines were detected elsewhere,
and only
a Gaussian ﬁtting were done. All the positions with signiﬁcant
emission in the (2,2) line
were also ﬁtted by Gaussian proﬁles.To estimate the ammonia abundance, X(NH 3), we have used
the 1.2
mm map of Motte et al. (2007) and computed the H 2col-
umn density following Motte et al. (1998).
Assumptions and for-
mulation are also exposed in the Appendix.
In the NH 3peak of the SW region,
where the (3,3) line was
observed and detected, we proceeded with a Boltzmann diagram
approach to
determine the rotational temperature and column
densities of the three velocity components. The
procedure is also
described in the Appendix.
4.2. Rotational and kinetic temperatures
The
distribution of the rotational temperatures ( Trot) is sketched
in Fig. 6. The values are written at
their corresponding positions,
superimposed to a Spitzer image at 8 m.
The blue labels correspond
to the points where the hf ﬁtting
was possible. All these positions belong to the IRDC (as said
above), and are characterized by a very low and uniform Trot, in
the range 7 11 K. The points having
two values of Trotcorre-
spond to those cases where two velocity components were ﬁtted.
The yellow
labels correspond to those points with both lines
ﬁtted by Gaussian proﬁles, and with derived values
of Trotlower
than 40 K. In case of non-detection of the (2,2) line, the values
are expressed as
upper limits. None of these points are correlated
to the IRDC, and it is hard to establish a
tendency across the
observed ﬁeld.
The red labels correspond to those positions where the (1,1)
line
remains undetected, and therefore the values of Trotare
lower limits. These “hot spots” are spread
over the whole ob-
served ﬁeld, but again avoiding the IRDC positions. As the hot
spots are located
in the under-sampled area, we have to interpret
them as small regions (less than 4000) with special
local condi-
tions. The peak of the (2,2) line in Fig. 4 –o set (000; 4000)– has
a lower limit of
Trotof 63 K.
The general picture of the region consists, therefore, of a
very cold and massive IRDC,
spotted by tenuous areas, some
of them depicting moderately high temperatures. This strong
dierence
in the temperatures among the IRDC and the other
positions is even larger if we consider the kinetic
temperatures
(Tk), because the ratio between TkandTrotincreases with Trot
(Danby et al. 1988;
Tafalla et al. 2004). At the IRDC, Tkis in
the range 8 12 K, while the positions having yellow
labels may
have Tkbetween 25 and 47 K. It is hard to constrain Tkin the hot
spots, although large
values, 100 K or even more, are possible.
4.3. Opacities in the IRDC
Fig. 7 depicts the opacities of
the main group ( min the ap-
pendix), derived when the hf ﬁtting is possible. The positions
correspond to the IRDC, and are labelled in blue, as in Fig. 6. Po-
sitions having two opacities
correspond to those cases with two
velocity components. As expected in the case of dark clouds, the
larger opacities are found toward the inner part of the IRDC. A
notable exception is found in the SW
region, where the opac-
ity remains high in the northern edge of the region, close to the
border of
the ring nebula.
4.4. Column densities and abundances
Fig. 8 depicts the distribution of the column
density, N(NH 3),
in the observed ﬁeld. The colour code is the same as in Fig. 6.
The estimates of
N(NH 3) in those hot spots (red labels) where
only lower limits to Trotare determined, was done by

overlaid to the 8 m
image of Spitzer. The values derived from hyperﬁne ﬁtting of the (1,1)
line are
labelled in blue; those derived from Gaussian ﬁtting of both
lines are shown in yellow; red labels
correspond to those positions hav-
ing the highest values of Trot(see text). In all cases, ﬁtting of

tures associated with
the IRDC, and higher values elsewhere are clearly

ingTrot=50 K; all lower limits to
Trotare higher than 50 K
and, therefore, the values of N(NH 3) are lower limits in all these
cases.
At the positions where we determined upper limits (yel-
low labels), we assumed Trot=10 K. In those
cases having two
velocity components, the sum of both N(NH 3) are depicted.
After looking at the
Fig. 8, the di erences between the IRDC
and the rest of the ﬁeld are outstanding. N(NH 3) varies
from
several 1014to some 1016cm 3at the IRDC positions, and is in
the range from 1012to
1013cm 3elsewhere.
This ample range of the N(NH 3) values also a ects the esti-
mates of abundances
with respect to H 2,X(NH 3). Fig. 9 shows
theX(NH 3) distribution in the ﬁeld, with the same colour
codes
as previous ﬁgures. To compute the NH 3abundance, we had to
estimate the H 2column density (
N(H2) at all positions. This is
inferred from the 1.2 mm continuum, considered a dust tracer.
Assumed dust temperatures were 10 K at the IRDC positions
and 50 K elsewhere (see the appendix for
details about the crite-
ria used.
The lowest values of the abundances, in the range from sev-
eral
10 11to some 10 9, are spread all along the observed ﬁeld
except in the IRDC, where the abundance
grows up to some
10 8. Interestingly, the abundance in the SW region remains high
at its northern
and south-western borders. This is not the ten-
dency expected in a quiescent clump of a dark cloud
like, for
instance, the other clumps of the IRDC.

In Fig. 10, we show the
Boltzmann diagram of the NH 3peak af-

compo-
nents. The velocity ranges and the velocity-integrated line inten-

tected in the red or

upper detection limits (3-sigma) have been computed in the
cor-
responding velocity ranges.

only derived lower
limits of Trot. As we also considered the column densities up
to the ﬁrst four
metastable levels (see Appendix), the resultant
values of N(NH 3) are therefore upper limits.
Most
of the gas (of the order of 1015cm 2) arises in the cen-
tral component and has a low value of
Trot(11 K); these values
ofTrotandN(NH 3) are those typically measured in the IRDC.
But strikingly,
there is much low amount of gas (three or-
ders of magnitude lower) at higher temperatures, above 28
K and
40 K. This ﬁnding conﬁrms the scenario depicted by the (1,1)
and (2,2) lines in the whole
ﬁeld: most of the dense gas is in cold
form and associated with the IRDC, which in turn is embedded
in a ﬁeld dotted by low amounts of warm /hot gas.
4.6. Anomalous NH 3(1,1) spectra in the SW region
We found anomalous satellite ratios in the NH 3(1,1) spectra at
four positions of the SW region.
Figure 11 shows the spectra, to-
gether with their locations. The positions a ected by this anoma-
lous emission lie at the outer edges of the SW region, two of
them close to the CO peak.
The blue
outer satellite hyperﬁne components are stronger
than those of the red side. This has been proposed
to be a sign-

post of contracting motions,

observationally (e. g. Fontani et al. 2012).
Alternatively, the
anomaly could be due to non-LTE emis-
sion due to hyperﬁne selective photon trapping, as this a

only the outer satellites. However, this e ect would produce the
opposite result; the red
satellite would become stronger than the
blue one (Stutzki & Winnewisser 1985).
5. Discussion
5.1.
Critical revision of the distances
The most recent distance estimate to some star-forming regions
of
Cygnus X is 1.4 kpc, based on spectroscopic parallaxes of
their maser-emitting regions (Rygl et al.
2012). This distance
is only slightly smaller than previous estimates using the same
technique
(Torres-Dodgen et al. 1991), and consistent with other
works based on stellar classiﬁcation (e. g.
Hanson 2003). On
the other hand, several studies locate DR15 at a lower distance,
about 700-800 pc
(Wendker et al. 1991; Uyanıker et al. 2001;
Redman et al. 2003).
However, the distance to the IRDC
is still a matter of de-
bate, with distances ranging from 800 to 1700 pc (Redman et al.
2003;
Kraemer et al. 2010). A close inspection of the infrared
images and submillimeter continuum emission
of a large ﬁeld of
view (200200) including G79.29 +0.46 reveals that the IRDC is
interrupted in two
positions: the SW region (e. g. Kraemer et al.
2010; Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010; Umana et al.
2011), and the
position of DR15 (see Fig. 2 of Redman et al. 2003). At ﬁrst
sight, the IRDC is
farther away than both DR15 and the LBV
nebula. However, the presence of a dark ﬁlamentary structure
extending to the north of the IRDC and crossing the LBV neb-
ula up to the position of the LBV star
suggests that part of the
IRDC is also in front of the LBV nebula (Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 11).
Therefore, provided that part of the IRDC seems to be in front
of the LBV nebula, and part of it
seems to be behind, it seems

reasonable to consider that the IRDC and the LBV nebula lie at
similar distances, of 1.4 kpc.
In addition, the overall NH 3(1,1) and 1.2 mm emission
shown in Fig.
1 reveal a discontinuity separating the SW region
and the westernmost clump of the IRDC, which is
coincident
with a bright 8 m structure extending from the infrared ring
farther to the south-west
(Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 11). This has been
proposed as an interaction zone of the LBV star with the sur-
rounding medium (Umana et al. 2011) and favours the associa-
tion of the LBV star with the IRDC.
The
ﬁnding of hot spots with low column density in the
ﬁeld of view toward G79.29 +0.46 leads us to
associate the
most tenuous ammonia to the Cygnus X star-forming region, or
even to G79.29 +0.46
itself. In this scenario, the warm /hot spots
may represent the relics of the clumps of the ancient
molecular
cloud, which are being photo-evaporated by the UV ﬁeld from
G79.29 +0.46, perhaps
supported by other neighbouring massive
stars. This idea is reinforced by the low abundance of NH
3mea-
sured near G79.29 +0.46, compatible with the idea of NH 3being
photo-dissociated by the strong
UV radiation present in the re-
gion. The high temperatures found in the nebula are consistent
with
the high dust temperature already found in the same region
(Waters et al. 1996; Jiménez-Esteban et
al. 2010).
In summary, we are providing here su cient arguments
which favour the possibility of
some co-existence of the IRDC
and G79.29 +0.46 in close volumes. Therefore, the interplay be-
tween
these two objects should be explored in more detail.
5.2. Hints of a possible interaction in the SW
region
As said above, the fraction of the IRDC which we mapped is
roughly divided in four regions,
more or less aligned from the
south-east corner of the map to its western border. In some as-
pects,
the SW region (one of these four regions) presents a num-
ber of peculiarities as compared to the
other three regions.The opacities measured in the SW region do not clearly de-
crease at the
borders, which is not the expected behaviour in a
typical cold dark cloud. In particular, the
opacity in the north-
ern edge –roughly a strip from (0” ; 120”) to ( 80”; 100”)–
remains as high as
in the centre. The abundance is also high
in some points of the same strip, up to one order of
magnitude
larger compared to the NH 3peak (located at the centre of the
SW region). The southern
border –a strip from (  30”; 200”) to
( 120”; 150”)– also depicts some points of high relative abun-
dance. The anomalous (1,1) satellite emission (Sect. 4.6) in the
external parts of the SW region is
also another peculiarity.
The large di erences in some parameters of the SW region,
in comparison
to the rest of the IRDC, should be due to di er-
ent physical conditions. An increase of the
abundances towards
the borders is not the expected tendency in the parts of a cold
cloud most
exposed to external UV radiation. The abundance
of NH 3in a harsh environment may be enhanced by
sputtering
in the presence of a C-type shock (Flower & Pineau des Forêts
1994; Draine 1995), which
releases volatile molecules from the
surface of the dust grains. This is a reasonable hypothesis
tak-
ing into account the presence of a low-velocity shock (about
14 km s 1) at the north-western
side of the SW region, close
to the CO peak (Rizzo et al. 2008). It is also worth noting that
the
northern edge of the SW region coincides with a brightening
and morphological disturbance of the
6-cm continuum emission,
which is claimed as an evidence of some interaction with the
surrounding
ISM (Umana et al. 2011). Therefore, these ammo-
nia observations may have unveiled the molecular
counterpart of
such disturbance, and also a new molecular component associ-
ated with the shocks
discovered in CO (Rizzo et al. 2008).
The positions of abundance enhancement towards the south-
ern
border of the SW region agree with those of the external in-
frared shell, better seen in 24 m
(Jiménez-Esteban et al. 2010,
and Fig. 9 of this work).

Rizzo et al.: NH 3associated with G79.29 +0.46
The scenario of the LBV star interacting with the
IRDC is
also consistent with the (3,3) spectrum towards NH 3peak, which
reveals two velocity
components tracing gas at temperatures &
30 K, clearly larger than the typical temperatures measured
in
the IRDC, of10 K.
Therefore, a number of observational ﬁndings points to a
possible interaction
of the nebula and the nested molecular shells
with the SW region. A deﬁnitive evidence will come
from obser-
vations with high angular resolution.
5.3. Triggered star formation in the SW region
If
the LBV star is interacting with the SW region this could af-
fect the star formation which is
currently ongoing in the area
(Vink et al. 2008). The dynamical time scale of the ejection
events
which produced the CO and infrared nested shells is 104–
105yr (Rizzo et al. 2008; Umana et al.
2011). This is compara-
ble to the age of the brightest young stellar object embedded in
the SW
region, assuming it is in the Class 0 phase (Greene et al.
1994; Kenyon & Hartmann 1995; Enoch et
al. 2009; Evans et al.
2009). Thus, while it seems unlikely that the ejection events of
the LBV
could have triggered the collapse of the young stel-
lar objects embedded in the SW region, an
interesting possibility
would be to explore whether they are a ecting the formation and
evolution
of the young stellar objects already formed.
After some 104 105yr of evolution, G79.29 +0.46 will
become a Wolf-Rayet star and the NH 3ring will even-
tually disappear. The stellar wind regime will
change at
this stage, turning it out to higher velocity and lower
wind density (Langer et al. 1994;
Maeder & Meynet 1994;
Garcia-Segura & Mac Low 1995). This will produce new
shocks in the surrounding
gas and dust, which may
release volatile molecules from the icy grain mantles
(Flower & Pineau des
Forêts 1994) and consequently increase
the ammonia abundance again. This line of reasoning is sup-
ported by the signiﬁcantly high NH 3abundance seen to the
north and south-western borders of the SW
region, a trend also
found in the molecular cloud around the WR nebula NGC 2359
(Rizzo et al.
2001a), and the Galactic Center (Flower et al. 1995;
Martín-Pintado et al. 1999). The young stellar
objects formed in
the SW region will probably su er photo-evaporation and heat-
ing of their
envelopes.
6. Conclusions
In order to study the molecular gas in the infrared ring nebula of
the LBV
star G79.29 +0.46 and its nearby IRDC, we used the Ef-
felsberg telescope to map the NH 3(1,1) and
NH 3(2,2) emission
in the G79.29 +0.46 ﬁeld. We additionally observed NH 3(3,3)
in particular
positions of the strongest NH 3(1,1) emission. Our
main ﬁndings are summarized as follows:
1. While
the strongest emission of NH 3(1,1) and (2,2) matches
the infrared-dark structure of the IRDC,
mainly detected at
velocities>1 km s 1, the emission in the velocity range
from 1:2 km s 1to+0:5 km
s 1reveals a coherent structure
closely following the infrared ring surrounding the LBV star,
also
partially seen in the (2,2) transition. This is the ﬁrst NH 3
structure associated with an evolved
massive star known so
far.
2. We derived the rotational temperature and NH 3column den-
sity of the
dense gas in the entire ﬁeld of view, and found that
the rotational temperature is uniform and in
the range 7–11 K
in the IRDC, while it is >30 K in particular positions or hotspots of the infrared
ring nebula and a couple of points within
3000of the LBV star. The NH 3column density in the IRDC is
in the range 1014–1015cm 2, while it is about two orders of
magnitude lower near the LBV and the
infrared ring. Using
the 1.2 mm continuum emission in the ﬁeld, we inferred NH 3
abundances of about
10 8in the IRDC, and 10 10–10 9near
the LBV star. The warm temperatures and low abundances
of NH
3near the LBV star and its infrared-ring suggest that
the gas is being heated and photo-dissociated
by the intense
UV-ﬁeld of the LBV star.
3. An outstanding region is recognized beyond the ring neb-
ula towards its south-western part, which is also part of the
IRDC (the SW region). The NH 3(3,3)
emission towards the
centre of the SW region reveals three velocity components.
One of them is
associated with the IRDC and has a rotational
temperature of 11 K, while the other two are
associated with
small dense cores with temperatures >30 K. In the northern
edge of the SW region,
the opacity of the (1,1) line keeps
a value as high as in the clump centre. The NH 3abundance
tends
to be higher at the clump edges than in the clump cen-
tre. All these features, together with the
results of previous
works reporting a shock within this region and hints of inter-
action with the
LBV star, strongly suggests that a mass-loss
ejection event of the LBV star is interacting with the
SW re-
gion and releasing NH 3molecules back to the gas phase, thus
increasing its abundance at the
outer edges of the clump.
G79.29 +0.46 is providing increasing evidences of being an
excellent
laboratory to study the history of a high-mass star evo-
lution. Being LBVs the precursors of core-
collapse supernovae
(through a Wolf-Rayet stage), the knowledge of the di erent ac-
tors present in
this ﬁeld may also help to learn about this topic.
The ammonia ring-like structure associated to
G79.29 +0.46 and
the SW region deserve follow up observations with high angu-
lar resolution.
Furthermore, the observation of other molecular
tracers would be of particular interest.

Appendix B: Formulation
In this appendix we summarize
the formula used for the de-
termination of some physical properties (opacities, rotational
temperatures, column densities, and abundances) from the ob-
served NH 3lines. This corresponds to
the standard interpreta-
tion already discussed and presented by several authors, such as
Ungerechts
et al. (1986) and Busquet et al. (2009).Appendix B.1: Hyperﬁne and Gaussian ﬁtting
The NH 3lines are
splitted by the quadrupole hyperﬁne interac-
tion (Ho & Townes 1983). From the relative intensities
of the
main hf group and the four satellite ones, it is possible to di-
rectly derive the optical
depth of the main hf group (Pauls et al.
1983). When the satellite (1,1) lines are detected, a CLASS
method was used for this ﬁtting. The output are: (1) Am=
f[J(Texc) J(Tbg)]m; (2) LSR velocity (
VLSR); (3) line width
at half maximum ( v); and (4)m, the opacity of the main
hf group. fis the
beam ﬁlling factor, and J(T) is Rayleigh-
Jeans temperature, deﬁned as J(T)=(h=k) (eh=kT 1) 1,
Tbg=2.73 K is the background temperature, and h and k are the
Planck and Boltzmann constants,
respectively.
This formulation assumes that all the hf levels are populated
according to local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions,
and a Gaussian velocity distribution. The level
population is
characterized by the excitation temperature Texc, which can be
cleared from the ﬁtting
by:
Texc=h=k
ln[1+h=kW 1]; (B.1)
where W=J(Texc)=A=f+J(Tbg).
The column density of a NH 3(J;K)
level, N(J;K), is ob-
tained by:
N(J;K)=1:65 1014
J(J+1)
K2v Texctotcm 2; (B.2)
whereis the line
frequency in GHz, totis the “total” opacity
of all the hf components, and vandTexcare in km s 1and
K,
respectively. The above equation results from solving the Trans-
port Equation for the NH
3molecule (Wilson et al. 2009), using
a dipole moment =1:469 D, and assuming Texc>>Tbg.
When the
hyperﬁne ﬁtting is possible, we estimate the col-
umn density of the (1,1) level, N(1,1), using the
above equation.
Numerically, it is computed by:
N(1;1)=2:785 1013v Texcmcm 2; (B.3)
where a rough
assumption of tot=2mis used.
When the hyperﬁne ﬁtting is not possible, we have assumed
optically
thin emission. In this case, Eq. (B.2) for the (1,1) line
turns out to:
N(1;1)=1:308 1013Z
TMBdvcm 2: (B.4)
In the above equation, all the hf components are included in
the integral. If the
integration extends only to the main group,
the coe cient should then be multiplied by a factor of
2.
In the case of the (2,2) line, the equivalent expression is:
N(2;2)=9:801 1012Z
TMBdvcm 2: (B.5)
Provided N(1;1) and N(2;2), the rotational temperature Trot
can be computed (Townes & Schawlow 1975;
Ho & Townes
1983) by:

where gJK=(2J+1)gopandEJKare the statistical weight and
the

the ortho and para species. In the
above equation we summed up
to the ﬁrst four levels3, and assumed that (1) only the metastable
levels are populated; (2) the levels are characterized by the LTE
temperature T; and (3) gopequals
to 2 and 1 for the ortho and
para species, respectively.
The total column density of all the
metastable lines may
be computed from a single line and by assuming a partition
function
characterized by T=Trot(e. g. Ungerechts et al. 1986;
Busquet et al. 2009):
N(NH

Appendix B.2: Abundances
The NH 3abundance is computed by
X(NH 3)=N(NH 3)=N(H2); (B.11)
where N(H2) is the H 2column density. To estimate it, we used
the
survey of the Cygnus region done by Motte et al. (2007) in
the 1.2 mm continuum emission.
At this
wavelength, most of the ﬂux arises from thermal dust
emission, which is optically thin. By assuming
a constant gas-
to-dust ratio, the 1.2 mm ﬂux results directly related to the total
gas. We
therefore used the formulation of Motte et al. (1998),
accordingly adapted to our case.
More
precisely, we have used their Eq. (1’), which compute
N(H2) as a function of the 1.2 mm ﬂux, the
dust temperature
(Tdust) and1:2mm, the dust opacity per unit mass column density.
The map of Motte
et al. (2007) was convolved to 4000
in order to match the 100m’s angular resolution. For 1:2mm
we
have adopted a value of 0.01 g 1(cm 2) 1, which corre-
sponds to the case of dust particles covered
by thin ice mantles
(Ossenkopf & Henning 1994), and is also a geometrical average

introduced by this simpliﬁcation is lower than 8 10 7%,
1.3 %, 3 %, and 17 % for Tk=10 K, 20 K, 50
K, and 100 K.between the values usually adopted for pre-stellar dense clumps
and circumstellar
envelopes in young stellar objects of class II
(Motte et al. 2007).
Under these assumptions, the
resulting formula is
N(H2)2 1020S(mJy)Tdust

where Sis the ﬂux at 1.2 mm in
the convolved map. Tdustis as-
sumed as 10 K in the IRDC positions, and 50 K elsewhere, con-
sistent
with the two dust population previously reported in the
region (Umana et al. 2011).
For the IRDC,
the assumed value of 10 K is compatible
with the Trotderived from the hf ﬁtting, because TkTrotat
low
temperatures, and the gas is thermalised at the dust tempera-
ture. At the other positions
–particularly in the ring nebula and
its interior– the continuum emission is bright at shorter wave-
lengths, such as 24 m, indicating a dust temperature probably
larger. By assuming a conservative
value of 50 K the derived
values of N(H2) have to be considered as upper limits and thus
X(NH 3) as
lower limits.
Appendix B.3: Rotational diagrams
The rotational diagram, also known as the Boltzmann
diagram
approach, is a rather common methodology used to derive the
rotational temperature and
column density of a given species.
The method is described in many works (see, for example,
Goldsmith & Langer 1999) and assumes a population of the lev-
els characterized by Trot, under LTE
conditions.
By taking logarithms to Eq. B.8, and after some algebra, we
obtain:
logN(J;K)=gJK= loge
Trot(EJK=k)+log[N(NH 3)=Q(Trot)]:
(B.13)
We see in the above equation that the
energy of the upper
levels are linearly related to the logarithms of the column densi-
ties.
If
three or more lines of a given species are measured, we
can deﬁne the abscissa xas(EJK=k), and the
ordinate yas
logN(J;K)=gJK.xandyare related by the usual linear equation
y=a x+b, and we can
therefore ﬁnd the least square regression
line. TrotandN(NH 3) can be obtained from the slope aand
the
constant term bby:
Trot= loge=a (B.14)
and
N(NH 3)=10bQ(Trot): (B.15)
