**Location:** Energy Conditions Test (Lines 130-136)

**Warnings Found:**
```
Energy Conditions:
   r/r_s       ρ [kg/m³]        p_r [Pa]        p_t [Pa]    WEC    DEC    SEC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1.20      -5.957e-23       5.354e-06      -1.071e-05      ✗      ✗      ✗
    1.50      -1.464e-23       1.316e-06      -3.072e-06      ✗      ✗      ✗
    2.00      -1.544e-24       1.388e-07      -5.556e-07      ✗      ✗      ✗
    3.00       3.050e-25      -2.741e-08      -2.764e-08      ✗      ✗      ✗
    5.00       1.028e-25      -9.237e-09       4.916e-09      ✓      ✓      ✓
   10.00       9.388e-27      -8.438e-10       7.361e-10      ✓      ✓      ✓
```

**Analysis:**
- ✗ (6 warnings) at r < 5r_s: **EXPECTED & DOCUMENTED**
- ✓ All satisfied at r ≥ 5r_s: **CORRECT BEHAVIOR**

**Physical Interpretation (Lines 142-145):**
```
Physical Interpretation:
  • p_r = -ρc² (radial tension balances density)
  • WEC/DEC/SEC violations confined to r < 5r_s
  • For r ≥ 5r_s: All energy conditions satisfied
  • Strong-field deviations controlled and finite
```

**Conclusion:** ✅ **These are NOT bugs - this is EXPECTED physics!**

**Why not a problem:**
1. Energy condition violations near horizon are **theoretically expected**
2. They are **confined** to strong-field region (r < 5r_s)
3. They are **finite** (not divergent)
4. For observable region (r ≥ 5r_s): **ALL SATISFIED**
5. Test explicitly **PASSES** (line 147)

---

### 4. Physical Interpretation Quality ✅ EXCELLENT

**All 7 physics tests have detailed interpretations:**

#### Test 1: PPN Parameters (Lines 47-51)
```
Physical Interpretation:
  • β = 1 → No preferred reference frame
  • γ = 1 → GR-like space curvature
  • SSZ matches GR in weak-field limit
  • Post-Newtonian tests (perihelion, bending) reproduce GR
```
✅ **Clear, accurate, pedagogical**

#### Test 2: Dual Velocity (Lines 93-97)
```
Physical Interpretation:
  • Dual velocity invariant holds to machine precision
  • v_fall can exceed c (dual scaling, not physical velocity)
  • γ_GR and γ_dual match exactly (consistent kinematics)
  • Validates SSZ segment-based gravity formulation
```
✅ **Addresses potential confusion (v > c)**

#### Test 3: Energy Conditions (Lines 142-145)
```
Physical Interpretation:
  • p_r = -ρc² (radial tension balances density)
  • WEC/DEC/SEC violations confined to r < 5r_s
  • For r ≥ 5r_s: All energy conditions satisfied
  • Strong-field deviations controlled and finite
```
✅ **Explains warnings, gives context**

#### Test 4: C1 Continuity (Lines 189-192)
```
Physical Interpretation:
  • C1 continuity ensures smooth metric transition
  • No discontinuities in curvature tensor
  • φ-based blending preserves segment structure
  • Hermite interpolation maintains derivative continuity
```
✅ **Technical but clear**

#### Test 5: C2 Strict (Lines 226-230)
```
Physical Interpretation:
  • C2 continuity ensures smooth Ricci curvature
  • No δ-function singularities in stress-energy
  • Analytic matching (machine-precision accuracy)
  • Quintic Hermite provides optimal smoothness
```
✅ **Advanced, mathematically precise**

#### Test 6: C2 Curvature Proxy (Lines 270-274)
```
Physical Interpretation:
  • Curvature proxy remains finite across joins
  • K ≈ 10⁻¹⁵ – 10⁻¹⁶ (extremely smooth)
  • C2 continuity ensures smooth Ricci tensor
  • No numerical artifacts or discontinuities
```
✅ **Quantitative, reassuring**

#### Test 7: SegWave Tests (Various)
Each of 20 tests has interpretation:
- Q-Factor tests explain temperature/density effects
- Velocity tests show flat rotation curve mechanism
- Frequency tests explain redshift
- All clear and pedagogical

✅ **Excellent educational value**

---

### 5. Numerical Precision Analysis ✅ EXCELLENT

**Machine Precision Results:**

1. **PPN Parameters:**
   - |β - 1| < 1e-12 ✅
   - |γ - 1| < 1e-12 ✅

2. **Dual Invariant:**
   - |(v_esc·v_fall)/c² - 1| = 0.000e+00 ✅
   - |γ_dual - γ_GR|/γ_GR = 1.741e-15 ✅

3. **C1 Continuity:**
   - |ΔA(r_L)| = 6.819e-10 < 1e-9 ✅
   - |ΔA'(r_L)| = 3.994e-11 < 1e-9 ✅

4. **C2 Continuity:**
   - |ΔA| = 0.000e+00 (machine zero) ✅
   - |ΔA'| = 1.355e-20 (machine precision) ✅
   - |ΔA''| = 0.000e+00 (machine zero) ✅

**Conclusion:** ✅ **All numerical results at or near machine precision**

---

### 6. Formatting & Readability ✅ EXCELLENT

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clear section headers with ====
- ✅ Consistent table formatting
- ✅ Unicode symbols (φ, β, γ, ≈, ×, →) work correctly
- ✅ Code blocks properly formatted
- ✅ Physical interpretations clearly separated
- ✅ Test results highlighted (✓ PASS)

**Example of excellent formatting:**
```
================================================================================
PPN PARAMETERS: SSZ Metric Exactness Test
================================================================================

SSZ Metric:
  A(U) = 1 - 2U + 2U² + ε₃U³
  B(U) = 1/A(U)
  ε₃ = -4.80

PPN Parameters (Weak-Field Limit):
  β (Preferred-Frame):  1.000000000000
  γ (Space-Curvature):  1.000000000000
  GR Prediction:        β = γ = 1.000000000000

Test Results:
  β = 1: ✓ PASS (|β-1| < 1e-12)
  γ = 1: ✓ PASS (|γ-1| < 1e-12)
```

✅ **Professional, readable, well-structured**

---

### 7. Completeness Analysis

#### What's Included ✅

**Complete information for each test:**
- ✅ Test name & purpose
- ✅ Configuration parameters
- ✅ Input values
- ✅ Expected results
- ✅ Actual results
- ✅ Pass/fail status
- ✅ Physical interpretation
- ✅ Execution time

**Summary Statistics:**
- ✅ Total duration (46.4s)
- ✅ Test suites count (7)
- ✅ Pass/fail counts
- ✅ Individual timings

#### What's Missing ⚠️

**Phase 3-4 Tests:**
- ⚠️ scripts/tests/ tests not shown
- ⚠️ cosmos/ tests not shown

**SSZ Complete Analysis:**
- ⚠️ No full pipeline run shown
- ⚠️ No redshift evaluation shown
- ⚠️ No mass validation shown

**Reason:** This is output from `run_full_suite.py` partial run (Phases 1-2 only)

**Impact:** ⚠️ **MINOR** - File title says "COMPLETE Full Output" but is actually partial

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Rename to "full-output-phases-1-2.md"
2. Add note: "Phases 1-2 only. For complete suite see: run_all_ssz_terminal.py"

---

### 8. Inconsistencies & Ambiguities

#### Issue 1: Misleading Title ⚠️

**Line 1:**
```markdown
# SSZ Suite - Complete Full Output Log
```

**Problem:** Says "Complete" but only shows Phases 1-2 (not 3-5)

**Fix:** Change to:
```markdown
# SSZ Suite - Test Output Log (Phases 1-2)
```

**Or add note:**
```markdown
# SSZ Suite - Complete Full Output Log

**Note:** This output shows Phases 1-2 (Root & SegWave tests).
For complete pipeline analysis, see: `run_all_ssz_terminal.py` output.
```

#### Issue 2: Summary Inconsistency ⚠️

**Lines 686-692:**
```
Total Phases: 7
Passed: 7
Failed: 0
```

**Problem:** Says "7 phases" but only shows 2 phases

**Analysis:**
- Probably means "7 test suites" within Phases 1-2
- Confusing terminology

**Fix:** Clarify:
```
Total Test Suites: 7
Total Phases Shown: 2 (Phase 1: Root-Level, Phase 2: SegWave)
Passed: 7/7 suites
Failed: 0
```

#### Issue 3: Missing Test Count ⚠️

**Summary says:**
```
Success Rate: 100.0%
```

**But doesn't say:** How many individual tests (49)

**Fix:** Add:
```
Total Individual Tests: 49 (all passed)
Success Rate: 100.0%
```

### 9. Potential Confusions for Users

#### Confusion 1: "6 Warnings" in Energy Conditions

**What user sees:** 6 ✗ marks

**Potential concern:** "Tests are failing!"

**Reality:** Expected physics, test PASSES

**Current mitigation:** ✅ Good - Physical Interpretation explains it

**Could improve:** Add note after table:
```
⚠️ Note: ✗ at r < 5r_s are expected strong-field deviations, not test failures.
Test verdict: ✓ PASS (conditions satisfied in observable region r ≥ 5r_s)
```

#### Confusion 2: "v_fall can exceed c"

**What user sees (Line 95):**
```
• v_fall can exceed c (dual scaling, not physical velocity)
```

**Potential concern:** "Faster than light?!"

**Current mitigation:** ✅ Good - Explicitly says "not physical velocity"

**Could improve:** Slightly more explicit:
```
• v_fall can exceed c (mathematical dual velocity, not motion of matter)
• No causality violation: This is a field scaling factor, not particle speed
```

#### Confusion 3: Incomplete Output

**What user expects:** "Complete Full Output" = all tests

**What they get:** Only Phases 1-2

**Current mitigation:** ❌ None - title is misleading

**Fix:** See Issue 1 above

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Misleading Title 🔴

**Current:**
```markdown
# SSZ Suite - Complete Full Output Log
```

**Recommended:**
```markdown
# SSZ Suite - Test Output Log (Phases 1-2: Root & SegWave)

**Generated:** 2025-10-19 06:10:39

This file contains test output from Phases 1-2 of the test suite:
- Phase 1: Root-Level SSZ Tests (7 physics tests)
- Phase 2: SegWave Tests (42 tests)

For complete pipeline analysis including data validation and SSZ runs, 
see output from: `run_all_ssz_terminal.py`

---
```

**Why:** Users deserve accurate expectations

---

### Priority 2: Clarify Summary Statistics 🟡

**Add to summary (after Line 692):**

```markdown
Test Coverage:
  Individual Tests: 49
  Test Suites: 7
  Phases Shown: 2 (of 5 total phases in full suite)
  
Note: This output shows Phases 1-2. Full test suite includes:
  - Phase 3: Scripts Tests (scripts/tests/)
  - Phase 4: Cosmos Tests (tests/cosmos/)
  - Phase 5: SSZ Complete Analysis
```

---

### Priority 3: Enhance Energy Conditions Note 🟢

**After line 136, add:**

```markdown

⚠️ **Important Note on ✗ Warnings:**
The 6 warnings (✗) at r < 5r_s are EXPECTED strong-field effects,
not test failures. Energy conditions are routinely violated near
horizons in modified gravity theories. The test PASSES because:
  1. Violations are confined to strong-field region
  2. All conditions satisfied in observable region (r ≥ 5r_s)
  3. Deviations remain finite (no singularities)
```

---

### Priority 4: Optional Improvements 🔵

1. **Add test count to summary:**
   ```
   Total Individual Tests: 49 (all passed)
   ```

2. **Cross-reference to full output:**
   ```
   For complete test suite output including all 5 phases, run:
   python run_full_suite.py --full
   ```

3. **Add timestamp to each test:**
   Currently only summary has timestamp
