Reproduces the physical reasoning of Carmen Wrede's answer:
- Why E = m_e * c^2 and QED are incomplete in the presence of strong gravity/segmentation.
- How to calculate local mass and fine-structure constant from observed frequencies using segmented spacetime.
- Why a detector electron can only "tap" a fraction of the original photon energy.

print("\nInterpretation:")
print("------------------------------------------------------------")
print("â€¢ QED is incomplete: it allows a running alpha,")
print("  but keeps the electron mass m_e fixed â€“ which is not correct in strong gravity.")
print("â€¢ Segmentation means that the measured electron mass and local alpha are smaller â€“")
print("  so the electron on Earth can only 'tap' a fraction of the original photon energy.")
print("â€¢ The measured photon energy is always a leftover (residual) of the original emitter energy â€“")
print("  the apparent loss is actually a projection effect due to spacetime structure at the detector.\n")
print("Result: The classical assumption that 'the photon loses energy along the way' is wrong â€“")
print("        it is local segmentation that limits what the electron can absorb!\n")
