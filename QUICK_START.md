# Quick Start Guide - SSZ Theory

**5-Minute Overview** | Get started with Segmented Spacetime with φ-Scaling

## 🎯 What is SSZ?

**Segmented Spacetime with φ-Scaling (SSZ)** is an alternative approach to gravity that:
- Uses discrete spacetime segments instead of continuous curvature
- Incorporates the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618 as a fundamental constant
- Resolves singularities through natural boundaries
- Reproduces General Relativity predictions in testable limits

## ⚡ Core Concepts (30 seconds each)

### 1. Spacetime Segments
Space is divided into discrete "segments" near massive objects.
- **Like:** Pixels in an image vs continuous canvas
- **Key:** Segments have finite size → no singularities!

### 2. φ-Radius (r_φ)
The characteristic length scale where segmentation becomes important.
- **Formula:** r_φ = φ·(GM/c²)·(1 + Δ/100)
- **For Sun:** r_φ ≈ 2390 m (smaller than Schwarzschild radius)

### 3. Natural Boundary
Spacetime naturally "stops" at r_φ - no infinite densities!
- **Result:** Black holes have finite-size cores
- **Bonus:** Singularity problem solved

### 4. Dual Velocity Invariant
Two complementary velocities that always satisfy: v_esc · v_fall = c²
- **Escape velocity:** How fast to escape gravity
- **Fall velocity:** Complementary infall measure
- **Invariant:** Their product is exactly c²

### 5. GR Compatibility
SSZ matches General Relativity where tested:
- **Weak field:** Same as Newton + Einstein
- **Strong field:** Similar predictions with modifications
- **PPN parameters:** β = γ = 1 (like GR)

## 📊 First Analysis (2 minutes)

```python
# Calculate φ-radius for the Sun
from core.physics import calculate_r_phi

M_sun = 1.989e30  # kg
r_phi = calculate_r_phi(M_sun)

print(f"φ-radius: {r_phi:.1f} m")
# Output: φ-radius: 2390.4 m
```

**Compare to Schwarzschild:**
- r_s (GR) = 2953 m
- r_φ (SSZ) ≈ 0.809 × r_s
