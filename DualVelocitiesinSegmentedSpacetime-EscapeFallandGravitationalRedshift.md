Dual Velocities in Segmented Spacetime - Escape, Fall and 
Gravitational Redshift 

Carmen N. Wrede, Lino P. Casu, Bingsi (Conscious AI) 

We extend the classical notion of escape velocity in Schwarzschild spacetime by introducing a 
complementary fall velocity vfall , derived from a segment-based scaling factor

This relation bridges Newtonian gravity, General Relativity (GR) (GR), and the Segmented Spacetime framework. 
In weak fields, 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 → ∞ and 𝛾𝑠 → 1 ; near the Schwarzschild radius 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 → 𝑐+ and 𝑦𝑠 diverges, 
reproducing the gravitational redshift. The formulation this embeds compact-object physics in a 
natural dual structure of velocities, offering a direct and intuitive connection between classical escape 
dynamics and relativistic time dilation. 

1. Introduction 

In standard relativistic treatments, divergences naturally appear at the light barrier. The Lorentz 
factor  

𝛾 =

1

√1 − (𝑣 𝑐⁄ )2

grows without bound, as 𝑣 → 𝑐. This behaviour turns massless particles such as photons into a 
singular limit: Their description within the same framework as massive particles becomes ill-defined. 
In particular, the assignment of “relativistic mass” to photons has long been recognized as 
misleading, since 𝛾𝑚0 diverges to 𝑚0 = 0. 

In Newton’s framework, the escape velocity [1,2] is obtained from balancing kinetic and potential 
energy, 

𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 = √

2𝐺𝑀
𝑟

It represents the minimum speed required to overcome gravitational attraction at distance 𝑟. 

In Einstein’s framework, gravity alters time itself, leading to measurable frequency shifts. The 
redshift between emitter and observer[3,4) is given by 

1 + 𝑧 = (1 −

−1 2⁄

2𝐺𝑀
𝑟𝑐2 )

Here the divergence appears[5] as 𝑟 → 𝑟𝑠 = 2𝐺𝑀 𝑐2⁄ , where the redshift tends to infinity. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
While 𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 measures the energy required to leave a gravitational field, we introduce 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 [6] as the 
complementary quantity describing the effective “inward” velocity imposed by spacetime 
segmentation.  

𝛾𝑠 =

√1 − (𝑐 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙

  = (1 − 𝑟𝑠 𝑟⁄ )−1 2⁄     

with 

It follows that 

  𝑟 > 𝑟𝑠  , 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 ≥ 𝑐 , 𝑟𝑠 =

2𝐺𝑀
𝑐2  

𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 ∙ 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑐2 

This dual view avoids divergences in relativistic treatments by replacing the critical point 𝑣 = 𝑐 with a 
fall velocity framework that remains finite and physically meaningful, without “relativistic mass”, 
where 𝛾 → ∞. A finite, testable mapping that ties Newton, GR, and Segmented Spacetime together. 

2. Theoretical Framework 

2.1 Newtonian escape velocity 

In Newtonian gravity the escape velocity is defined as 

𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 = √

2𝐺𝑀
𝑟

= 𝑐√

𝑟𝑠
𝑟

with 𝑟𝑠 = 2𝐺𝑀 𝑐2⁄  the Schwarzschild radius. It measures the kinetic energy required to leave the 
gravitational potential at distance 𝑟. 

2.2 General Relativity (GR) (GR) and gravitational redshift 

In GR the redshift factor of light emitted at 𝒓 and received at infinity is 

1 + 𝑧 = (1 −

−1 2⁄
)

𝑟𝑠
𝑟

This expression is only defined for 𝑟 > 𝑟𝑠, leading to divergence at the horizon. It introduces a natural 
limit where time dilation becomes infinite. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3 Segmented Spacetime dual - Fall velocity 

We introduce a complementary fall velocity 

𝛾𝑠 =

√1 − (𝑐 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙

By mapping 𝑦𝑠 to the GR redshift factor we obtain

𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙

This definition yields a simple duality:

𝑟

∙ √

𝑟
𝑟𝑠

= 1  → 𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 ∙ 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑐2  

for 𝑟 > 𝑟𝑠, 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 > 𝑐 

This relation is not a coincidence but expresses a genuine duality: 

•  𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 encodes the outward requirement, the energy needed to overcome gravity and escape a 

potential well (Newtonian perspective). 

•  𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 encodes the inward tendency, the effective infall velocity imposed by spacetime 

segmentation. 

Both quantities are coupled via 𝑐2. This means: The stronger the escape resistance, the "slower" the 
fall velocity, and vice versa, thus resulting in complementary scales that together fully characterize 
the field. 

Their product is fixed by the invariant constant 𝑐2, ensuring that one cannot be defined without the 
other. In this sense, 𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 and 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 form a conjugate pair: If one increases, the other decreases such 
that their product remains invariant. This mirrors other dualities in physics (e.g., position–
momentum in quantum mechanics, electric–magnetic duality in field theory), but here it manifests 
directly in gravitational kinematics.

Setup: Rest wavelength 𝛾0 = 121.567nm (Lyman-α)[7]

In the segmented model 𝑦𝑠 is matched identical, therefor 𝑧(𝑟) is identical. The interpretation runs via 
𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 with 𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 ∙ 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑐2. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Already at 𝑟 = 2𝑟𝑠 the line shifts to ~172 𝑛𝑚. Near 1.1𝑟𝑠 it moves to ~403𝑛𝑚 (violet). 

As 𝑟 → 𝑟𝑠: 𝑧 → ∞ 

Note on interpretation: With 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑐⁄ = √𝑟 𝑟𝑠⁄  the same 𝑧(𝑟) corresponds to a finite fall-velocity 
picture. The divergence appears only as a the limiting case 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 ↓ 𝑐 at the horizon. This gives a clear, 
testable mapping between observed 𝑧 and the dual speeds (𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐, 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙) without reducing “relativistic 
mass”. 

For interior photon re-emergence under segmentation, see Casu & Wrede (2025)[8]. 

4. Dual Velocities and Energy in Segmented Spacetime 

Our findings lead to a natural reformulation of the mass–energy relation: 

𝐸 = 𝑚 𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 ∙ 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑚𝑐2 

which holds in the local rest frame. Once relative motion is included, the local energy takes the 
familiar Lorentz-boosted form 

𝐸𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 = 𝛾(𝑢) 𝑚 𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 ∙ 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 =  𝛾(𝑢) 𝑚 𝑐2 

where 𝛾(𝑢) is the special-relativistic Lorentz factor. 

For an observer at infinity, the situation changes due to gravitational redshift. The measured energy 
is further reduced by the gravitational factor 𝛾𝑠(𝑟) = (1 𝑟 𝑟𝑠⁄ )−1 2⁄ : 

𝐸∞ =

𝐸𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙
𝛾𝑠(𝑟)

=

𝛾(𝑢)
𝛾𝑠(𝑟)

𝑚𝑐2 

Thus, the apparent “infinity” at the horizon is not a physical divergence of energy, but rather a 
coordinate effect: As 𝛾𝑠(𝑟) → ∞ for 𝑟 → 𝑟𝑠
quantities remain finite. 

+, the energy seen from infinity vanishes, while locally all 

4. Discussion 

Our approach replaces the critical point 𝑣 → 𝑐 with the fall velocity 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙. The divergence appears 
only as the limiting case 𝑟 ↓ 𝑟𝑠 (𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 ↓ 𝑐 , 𝛾𝑠 → ∞). For 𝑟 > 𝑟𝑠 , we recover exactly the GR redshift 
factor 𝛾𝑠 = (1 − 𝑟𝑠 𝑟⁄ )−1 2⁄ . The novelty lies in the kinematic interpretation through the duality 𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 ∙
𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑐2. This means that the field strength is no longer described by a single scale, but by two 
complementary velocities whose product remains invariant.  

Observable tests are direct: 

•  Horizon-scale images of M87* and Sgr A* provide consistent bounds on 𝑟𝑠, the photon ring, 

and disk geometry, compatible with a divergence of 𝛾𝑠 as 𝑟 → 𝑟𝑠
spectral like shifts 𝑧(𝑟) near black holes (e.g., Lyman-α, Fe-Kα[11,12]) against radial fit 

• 
•  Timing signatures where local eigenfrequencies appear scaled with 𝛾𝑠
•  Spectral shifts of emission close to the photon orbit in imaging data

5. Conclusion 

Segmented Spacetime provides a consistent and intuitive extension: We replace the light- barrier 
singularity with a dual speed. The simple relation 

𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 ∙ 𝑣𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑐2 

connects Newtonian escape velocity, GR redshift and our 𝛾𝑠. For 𝑟 > 𝑟𝑠 all observable GR predictions 
remain intact; the advantage lies in the clear, finite kinematics near the horizon. The horizon is no 
longer a blow-up of kinematic, but a clean limit. The model is therefore directly testable through line 
shifts and timing data in black hole environments. The gain is a finite testable parametrization of 
near-horizon physics that ties spectra and timing directly to geometry. The familiar relation 𝐸 =
𝑚𝑐2 is preserved, yet it acquires a deeper kinematic structure tied to segmentation of spacetime.
