ABSTRACT

The ‘Diamond Ring’ within Cygnus X, south-west of the DR21 ridge, stands out as a
prominent, nearly circular structure in infrared
(IR) and far-infrared (FIR) emission, spanning
approximately 6 pc in diameter. It is enclosed by clumpy molecular clouds seen in
CO lines and
contains an H II region, visible in cm emission. It resembles a classical H II region associated
with an expanding bubble
seen routinely in the 158 µm line of ionised carbon ([C II]). However, our
recent observations utilising the Stratospheric Observatory
for Far-Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) under
the FEEDBACK program for the spectrally resolved [C II] line have revealed a slightly
tilted ring
with a mass of ∼103 M⊙, advancing at a velocity of ∼1.3 km s−1. The bulk emission of the gas has a
line-of-sight (LOS)
velocity around −2 km s−1. The [C II] data revealed that the ‘Diamond’ of the
Diamond Ring is an unrelated, dense gas clump at a
LOS velocity of ∼7 km s−1. The driving source,
which is also responsible for powering the associated H II region, is a B0.5e star,
classified by
our IR spectroscopy. This observation marks the first instance where we observe only a slowly
expanding ring of [C II]
emission and not an expanding 3D shell. We suggest that the H II region
(along with its associated [C II] bubble), initially formed by a
massive star, expanded outwards
from a flat slab of molecular gas nearly in the plane of the sky. Presently, the [C II] ring is
confined
by the swept-up gas of the slab, while the parts of the shell moving in the directions
perpendicular to the shell along the LOS have
dissipated, resulting in a notable decrease in the
expansion of the remaining ring. This scenario is supported by dedicated simulations
that trace the
evolution of the [C II] bubble. Our observations support the scenario of H II region evolution in
‘flat’ molecular clouds,
reported earlier in the literature. In this geometry, we propose that the
Diamond Ring represents the terminal phase of an expanding
[C II] bubble driven by stellar winds and
thermal pressure.

1. Introduction

The radiation and stellar
winds emitted by OB stars inject sub-
stantial radiative, thermal, and mechanical energy into the
inter-
stellar medium (ISM). In recent years, a highly effective method
for quantifying stellar
feedback has been to utilise the fine-
structure line of ionised carbon ([C II]) at 158 µm because
it
probes photo-dissociated regions (PDRs), where far-ultraviolet
(FUV) photons predominantly
determine the physical and chem-
ical properties of the gas (Hollenbach & Tielens 1999). Notably,
observations conducted with the Stratospheric Observatory for
Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) have
enabled velocity-resolved
mapping of [C II] around H II regions, revealing the presence of

radially
expanding [C II] shells (Pabst et al. 2019; Luisi et al.
2021; Tiwari et al. 2021; Beuther et al.
2022; Bonne et al. 2022).
They are most visible as high-velocity red- or blueshifted emis-
sion in
[C II] spectra and display an ellipse in position-velocity
(PV) cuts. The maximum expansion
velocities along the line-of-
sight (LOS) in the central part of the bubble typically surpass
the
sound speed of approximately 10 km s−1, characteristic of
photo-ionised gas. This led to the
conclusion that the [C II] bub-
bles are predominantly driven by the stellar winds of the excit-
ing
OB star(s), as depicted in analytical models (Weaver et al.
1977). Lower expansion velocities of
evolved [C II] shells have
also been observed in Orion (Pabst et al. 2020). However, only
recently,
Keilmann et al. (2025) detected a very young [C II] bub-

The nearby Cyg OB2 association with 169 O stars (Wright et al.
2015) illuminates the entire complex. The Diamond Ring itself
is associated with an H II region that
fills the cavity (Lockman
1989; Kuchar & Clark 1997) with its exciting source most plau-
sibly being
star #227 from Comerón et al. (2008). A NIR spec-
troscopy study for of this star is also presented
in the present
paper. Figure 2 c shows a map taken at 4.88 GHz (6 cm), where
it becomes obvious that
the ionised gas fills the Diamond Ring,
with stronger emission in the eastern part. This could be
due to
a density gradient within the H II region and radiation leakage
from the embedded cluster
located in the eastern clump within
the Diamond ring. The protostellar sources within this clump
(Kryukova et al. 2014) are well visible in the 24 µm image in
Fig. 2 a).
The Diamond Ring has the
same velocity as the molecular clouds
associated with the DR21 ridge at ∼ −2 km s−1 in the Cygnus X
North region, so we adopted a distance of 1.5 kpc (Rygl et al.
2012). Here, we demonstrate that the
‘Diamond’ component of
the Diamond Ring in the south-east, containing a cluster of B
stars referred
to as Cl 13 in Le Duigou & Knödlseder (2002) or
cluster 16 in Dutra & Bica (2001), is a LOS feature
unrelated
to the ring at a velocity of around +7 km s−1. The objective of
this paper is to
understand how this peculiar [C II] ring has been
formed and how it evolves. To achieve this aim, we
use [C II]
data from the SOFIA legacy program FEEDBACK (Schneider
et al. 2020), along with archival
molecular line, dust continuum
and radio data, and new optical observations of star #227. The
SOFIA
and optical observations are described in Sect. 2. All data
sets are presented and analysed in Sect.
3. We also performed a
dedicated 3D simulation, informed by observational parameters,
where the
radiation and stellar wind of a massive star erode a
slab of gas (Sect. 4). In Sect. 4, we also
develop a physical sce-
nario for the Diamond Ring and discuss the observed timescales.
Section 5
summarises the paper.

2. Observations

2.1. SOFIA

The Diamond Ring was mapped as part of a large-
scale mapping
of the Cygnus X north region within the SOFIA FEEDBACK
legacy program. 2 The [C II]
158 µm line was observed using the
upGREAT receiver (Risacher et al. 2018). The half-power beam
width at 158 µm is 14.′′1 and the typical main beam efficiency
is approximately 0.65. We use data
that we spatially smoothed
to angular resolutions of 20′′, on a Nyquist sampled 8′′ grid, and
15′′
in a 5′′ grid. The 20′′ spectra were resampled to a velocity
resolution of 0.3 km s−1 and 1 km s−1
and have an average rms
baseline noise of 0.8 K and 0.5 K at these velocity resolutions.
At 15′′
angular resolution the average rms baseline is 1.05 K at
0.3 km s−1 velocity resolution. For further
technical details, we
refer to Schneider et al. (2020, 2023) and Bonne et al. (2023).

2.2.
Spectroscopy with the Nordic Optical Telescope

Spectroscopy of star #227 was obtained on the night
of 27 and
28 June 2024 with the NIR camera and spectrograph NOTCam
at the Nordic Optical Telescope
(NOT) at La Palma, Spain. Two
separate settings were used, covering the H band (1.48-1.78 µm)
and
the K band (1.95-2.36 µm). The slit used had a width of 0′′6,

ble characterised by a small
compact H II region and an extended,
slowly expanding (∼2.6 km s−1) [C II] shell.

We report the
first detection of a distinct ring1 of [C II] emis-
sion within the Cygnus X region that is devoid
of any spherical
shell-like configuration, but displaying, in fact, a radial expan-
sion in the
plane of the sky at ∼1.3 km s−1. This feature cor-
responds to the ‘Diamond Ring’ (Marston et al.
2004), situated
south-west of the DR21 ridge (Schneider et al. 2010), cf. the Her-
schel map
displayed in Fig. 1. The whole area forms a complex
network of clouds and filaments, hypothesised to
result from
the interaction of predominantly atomic flows (Schneider et al.
2023). All western
filaments, in particular, filament SW (nota-
tion from Hennemann et al. (2012)), reveal a connection
to the
ring. The Diamond Ring (or at least parts of it) is also conspic-
uous in the near- and mid-
infrared (NIR-MIR) (Marston et al.
2004; Beerer et al. 2010; Kryukova et al. 2014). In Fig. 2 a and
b, we map the Spitzer 24 and 8 µm data. It is also discernible in
CO transitions (see Fig. 2 d) and
the [C II] line (Schneider et al.

1 We observe a ring as a projected structure on the sky. As we
will
demonstrate later, the parental molecular cloud likely exhibits a slab-
like morphology.
Consequently, in three-dimensional space, the overall
geometry is best described as a toroidal
structure.

in each position, a set of ten
exposures of 4 s was obtained in each filter. The exposure time
was
thus 160 s in each filter, which was sufficient to obtain a

H band and 170 in the K
band, respectively. A correction of telluric features was achieved

and 2.55′′ angular resolution, respectively, from
the Spitzer Cygnus X legacy survey (Kryukova et
al. 2014) and
FIR continuum images from Herschel, shown in Schneider et al.

2.3.
Complementary data

We used 12CO and 13CO 1→0 data from the Nobeyama 45m
telescope Cygnus survey,
described in detail in Yamagishi et al.
(2018) and Takekoshi et al. (2019). The original angular
reso-
lution is 16′′ and the velocity resolution 0.25 km s−1; however,
for the purposes of this
study, we used data smoothed to 20′′

Finally, we also made use of radio continuum data at 4.88
GHz
from the GLOSTAR (Brunthaler et al. 2021; Gong et al.
2023) survey, which combines data taken at the
Effelsberg 100m
telescope and the VLA. For technical details, we refer to these
papers. Here, we use
an Effelsberg-only map with a resolution
of 145′′.

the ring is

correspond to Cl13 and the high-velocity
gas, respectively Schneider et al. (2023).

and 13CO 1→0 lines. The spectrum reveals a complex veloc-
ity structure, with emission
originating from previously identi-
fied molecular cloud complexes in Cygnus X (Schneider et al.
2006; Cao et al. 2019; Schneider et al. 2023). We focus on the
velocity range from −8 to 3 km s−1,
which corresponds to the
Diamond Ring. We did not detect the [13C II] hyperfine struc-
ture
components F(1-0) and F(1-1), which have velocity shifts
of −65.1 km s−1 and +63.2 km s−1,
respectively, relative to the
bulk emission at −2 km s−1. The F(2-1) component has a veloc-
ity
shift of 11.3 km s−1 and, thus, it would be expected to appear
around 7 km s−1. This makes the line
difficult to detect because
of the bulk emission of the Diamond with Cl 13 at that velocity.
The PV
cuts and channel maps clearly demonstrate that
the ‘Diamond’ of the Diamond Ring, identified as Cl
13 in
Le Duigou & Knödlseder (2002), is detached from the ring
in velocity space, with its bulk
emission centred at 7 km s−1.
The peak of the [C II] emission originates from a clump located
east
of star #227, which exhibits a protrusion extending toward
this source. The clump contains four
protostellar objects with
luminosities above 10 L⊙ (Kryukova et al. 2014). We note that
the CO (1→0)
emission (Figs. 2 d) and 3) is very fragmented at
all velocities and does not form a coherent ring-
structure, as we
see in [C II]. Moreover, the CO emission appears to wrap around
the [C II] emission
and the ring. The channel maps (Fig. 3) show
that at −2 km s−1, the SW filament (Fig. 1) is clearly
observed
in CO (while more diffuse in [C II]), while at 7 km s−1, the
molecular cloud associated
with Cl 13 becomes prominent.

The most important aspect to consider here is the lack of sig-
nificant blue- or redshifted [C II] emission in the centre of the
ring at high velocities (at least
a few km s−1 away from the bulk
emission), which is typically associated with the 3D expansion
of a
radiation or wind-blown bubble (see references in Sect.1).
Our 1σ detection limit is 0.52 K km s−1
in the channel map of
Fig. 3 and 1.94 K km s−1 for the line-integrated (−8 to 3 km s−1)
[C II] map.
The noise level in the channel map corresponds to a
typical [C II] column density of NCII = 9.4 ·
1015 cm−2 (follow-
ing the equations presented later). A possible [C II] shell, how-
ever, would
only be visible at high red- and blueshifted veloci-
ties and would cover a smaller velocity range
(not including the
bulk emission). Typical line widths of expanding [C II] shells are
around 5 km
s−1 (Luisi et al. 2021; Bonne, L. et al. 2023), lead-
ing to NCII = 2.4 · 1016 cm−2. We observed
slightly blueshifted
(∼ −2 to −3 km s−1 LOS velocity) emission in the southeast-
ern region and
redshifted (∼ −1.5 to 0.5 km s−1) emission in the
northwestern region, as displayed in Fig. 6. An
increased veloc-
ity dispersion (Fig. A.2) is observed in the northeastern part of
the Diamond Ring,
where the SW filament intersects the ring.
Ram pressure caused by collision with this filament could
ex-
plain the higher velocity dispersion. However, this will be in-
vestigated in a separate study,
using recently obtained molecular
line data (Dannhauer et al., in prep.). In contrast, the higher
ve-
locity dispersion further south in the ring is likely a consequence
of enhanced turbulence
induced by stellar feedback from the in-
ternal B-type stars within the clump located east of star
#227.
The higher [C II] intensity of up to 140 K km s−1 in this clump
(compared to typical values of
60-70 K km s−1 in other regions
of the Diamond Ring) is most likely also caused by internal stel-
lar feedback.

We assume that the elliptical appearance of the Diamond
Ring arises from the
inclination of the ring, which produces
the observed velocity difference between the northwestern
and
southeastern regions. A sheet-like assembly of the clouds in
Cygnus X was already proposed in
Schneider et al. (2023), based

on the overall emission distribution of CO-dark gas only seen
in [C
II]. In particular the DR21 ridge was found to be formed
in such a way, demonstrated by the typical
observed V shape
in [C II]-PV cuts (Bonne et al. 2023). This scenario is further
supported by
dedicated simulations (Sect. 3.4) and discussed in
Sect. 4. A tilt angle of ∼34o and a radial
expansion velocity of
∼1.3 km s−1 was derived with the methodology and details pro-
vided in
Appendix B. A similar expansion velocity was obtained
from spectra and position-velocity cuts for
the [C II] bubble of
NGC 1977 in Orion, driven by a B1V star (Pabst et al. 2020).

3.2. The H II
region and the exciting star of the Diamond Ring

Comerón et al. (2008) identified 96 candidate
massive stars in
the outskirts of Cyg OB2 of which star #227 is the most likely
exciting source for
the H II region associated with the Diamond
Ring, due to its spatial location. Figure 2 shows the
extent of
the H II region within the cavity of the Diamond Ring in 24 µm
and 6 cm free-free
emission. From the spectroscopy of the star
(details in Appendix C), we conclude that star #227 is
an early-
type Be star, most likely a Herbig B0.5e with an uncertainty of
about one spectral
subclass. These relatively young stars have
masses between 10 to 16 M⊙.

3.3. Physical properties of
the Diamond Ring

In the following, we only give a summary of the calculated val-
ues, with further
details given in Appendix D. From the observed
line-integrated (−8 to 3 km s−1) [C II] intensities
and assuming
optically thin emission 3, we derived an average column [C II]
density of NCII = 9.7 ·
1017 cm−2, which translates to a total
mass of the atomic PDR gas of 1083 M⊙ for the whole ring.
From the GLOSTAR cm-data, we obtained the ionising flux and
determined an electron density of 86
cm−3 for a temperature of
8000 K.
By estimating the pressure of the H II region and comparing it to
the simulations of H II regions by Tremblin et al. (2014), which
account for the ram pressure of an
external medium, we obtained
the picture of an evolved H II region with an age of approxi-
mately
2–2.5 Myr. The upper limit for the age of the associated
[C II] ring is given by the dynamical
timescale inferred from the
expansion velocity, assumed to be constant over time, yielding
tdyn ∼
2.2 Myr. In Sect. 4.3, we discuss how these commonly
employed age estimates overestimate the age of
the observed
structure by not accounting for the effect of the environment on
the evolution.

Simulating stellar feedback in a slab of gas

The observations discussed in Sect. 3 reveal an
expanding ring
of gas traced by the [C II] emission line, without evidence of a 3D
bubble structure
typically observed and reported in the literature.
This configuration may arise when a star evolves
within a ‘flat’
molecular cloud, as proposed by Beaumont & Williams (2010).
To show that such a
geometry, combined with stellar feedback
effects of a B0.5 star, can explain the observed structure,
we per-
formed dedicated simulations. For that purpose, we placed such
a star in a slab of gas with
varying slab thicknesses and initial
densities and conducted simulations with ionising radiation and
with and without stellar wind. Trying to use the simplest model

3 We found no indications for a
high optical depth or self-absorbed
[C II] line in the DR as it was observed in other PDRs
(Kabanovic et al.
2022).

reproduces key observables, we chose to neglect magnetic
fields and turbulence. In Fig. 7, we
present synthetic [C II] obser-
vations of the simulation that offer the best match to the obser-
vations, but first we begin with a description of the simulation
set-up.

We performed 3D
hydrodynamics simulations with the Eu-
lerian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code Flash 4 (Fryxell
et al. 2000). The standard piecewise parabolic method (PPM)
was used to solve the Euler equations.
Self-gravity was cal-
culated using the Octtree-based solver described in Wünsch
et al. (2018). The
same solver was used to calculate the lo-
cal attenuation of the FUV radiation for every cell with
the
TreeRay/OpticalDepth module. The radiative transport equa-
tion for extreme ultraviolet
radiation (EUV) was solved with the

TreeRay/OnTheSpot module (Wünsch et al. 2021), which uses
the
on-the-spot approximation in combination with a backwards
ray-tracing method. It also utilises the
underlying tree structure
to make the computation more efficient. As multipole acceptance
criterion
(MAC) for all TreeRay modules, we used a simple ge-
ometric MAC (Barnes & Hut 1986), which accepts a
node if
its angular size is smaller than a chosen limit angle, and set
θlim = 0.25 rad (see Wünsch
et al. (2018, 2021) for more de-
tails). We used the chemical network originally implemented in
Glover & Mac Low (2007a,b) and extended it in Glover et al.
(2010) to the network of Nelson & Langer
(1999). The imple-
mentation in Flash 4 was presented in Walch et al. (2015) and
it has since been
updated by Mackey et al. (2019) and Gaches
et al. (2023). The network follows the abundances of 32
species.

ulate a molecular cloud that gets irradiated from the
outside by
an isotropic background radiation field. It computes the attenu-
ation of FUV radiation
as it travels to a point, which we refer
to as the target cell, inside of the MC. The module
calculates
column densities along multiple sight lines from the perspective
of the target cell and
averages them to determine the overall at-
tenuation. In our set-up, however, the FUV radiation
originates
from a single stellar source and it is particularly important to
accurately model the FUV
field at the PDR, where most of the
[C II] emission is produced, as this determines how much carbon
is present in the form of CO, C0, or C+. The PDR is located at
the edge of the H II region, where
the expanding shock continu-
ously sweeps up gas into a swept-up ring (SUR). We assumed
that the FUV
radiation from the central star is primarily attenu-
ated by the SUR itself. Therefore, we limited
the path length over
which TreeRay/OpticalDepth integrated column densities along
the sight lines to
the thickness of the SUR. Unlike the study done
by Rathjen et al. (2025), we did not limit the range
of the FUV
radiation.

time steps. The full
simulation box is further elongated along the x-direction to cap-
ture the
propagation of the fast bipolar outflow. The time evolu-
tion is shown from left to right. The
orange contour marks the
position of the ionization front and the black arrows show the
direction of
the gas velocity. The direction with an inclination of
34◦ from which the DR is observed is

An animated version of the first and third panel can be found on-
line.
The full non-equilibrium evolution was followed for 19 species:
e−, H+, H, H2, He, He+, C, C+, O,
O+, OH, H2O, CO, C2, O2,
HCO+, CH, CH2, and CH+

assumed to be in chemical equilibrium: H−, H+

OH+, H2O+, H3O+, CO+, HOC+, O−, C− and O+

The ionising
radiation was coupled to the chemistry network, from which the
heating and cooling
terms were calculated (Haid et al. 2018).
The stellar properties were obtained from the stellar
tracks of
Ekström et al. (2012) (hereafter, ‘Geneva tracks’). The termi-
nal wind velocities were
not given in the tracks; therefore, they
were calculated according to the procedure described in
Gatto
et al. (2017). FUV radiation is treated ‘adaptively’ as described
in Rathjen et al. (2025)
with some adjustments for this simula-
tion set-up. Instead of using a constant background value, we
calculate the FUV luminosity for each star and map the resulting
FUV radiation field onto the grid.
This takes into account that the
radiation field around each star is geometrically diluted accord-
ing to the inverse-square law (G0 ∝ R−2). The FUV luminosity
of a star is calculated by integrating
its spectrum from 5.6 eV to
13.6 eV. We assumed the spectrum to be a black body with an
effective
temperature obtained from the Geneva stellar tracks. A
background field of Gbg = 0.0948 (Rathjen et
al. 2025) is added
and the dust attenuation calculated by TreeRay/OpticalDepth is
applied.
TreeRay/OpticalDepth was originally designed to sim-

The set-up consisted of an elongated box with
dimensions
36 pc × 12 pc × 12 pc filled with a uniform diffuse gas with a
number density of nH = 1
cm−3 and a slab with enhanced density
located in the y-z-plane. All gas was initialised in thermal
and
chemical equilibrium. We varied the slab thickness using values
of 1 pc, 2 pc, 2.5 pc, and 3 pc
and the slab number density using
values of nH = 167 cm−3, 250 cm−3, 350 cm−3, and 500 cm−3.
The
density range was motivated by the study by Schneider et al.
(2023), where it was shown that
molecular clouds built up by the
interaction of atomic (number density of at least 100 cm−3) and
molecular flows at a temperature of ∼100 K.

The carbon abundance is set to C/H=1.6·10−4 (Sofia et
al.
2004). All carbon is initialised in the form of C+, which is
close to the chemical equilibrium
state for all initial densities.
The slab consists of mostly H2 with number fractions of above
H2/H
= 0.495 and temperatures of T ≈ 100 K, where the
exact equilibrium abundances and temperatures
depend on the
slab density. The diffuse surrounding gas has a temperature of
T = 814.5 K and
consists of mostly atomic hydrogen with small
H2/H = 7 · 10−3 and H II/H = 1 · 10−7 number
fractions. We
used the AMR technique (Fryxell et al. 2000) to refine the grid
at the position of
cells with more than twice the initial slab den-
sity, ensuring that the dense and shocked material
at the edge of
the H II region in the SUR was optimally resolved. The base grid
has a resolution of
dx = 12 pc/128 ≈ 0.094 pc and the highest
resolution level corresponds to dx = 12 pc/512 ≈ 0.023 pc.
At t = 0, a single massive star was placed in the centre of
the slab, creating an H II region
initially confined by the dense
gas. As the central star, we chose a 16 M⊙ B0.5 ZAMS star,
in
accordance with our observations. We simulated its ionising
radiation and stellar wind. We speculate
that this star was ei-
ther formed as a result of the interaction of gas flows (Schnei-
der et al.
2023), which built up a dense clump in which a
massive star formed, or it is a runaway star that was
formed
further away and now crosses the slab of gas. The mass loss
rate of the star is ˙M⋆ = 1.2 ·
10−8 M⊙yr−1, the Lyman con-
tinuum flux 4 is NLy = 9.8 · 1047 s−1, the terminal wind
velocity is vw
= 2.7 · 103 km s−1 and the FUV luminosity is
LFUV = 4.6 · 1037 erg s−1. We ran a set of simulations
but show
here only the set-up that best matches the observations. We de-
termined the best-matching
simulation by comparing integrated

intensities, morphology, dynamics,
and H II region pressure at a
time step when the observed and simulated [C II] rings matched
in size
(with a diameter of approximately 6 pc).
The different evolutionary stages of the expansion of the H
II re-
gion can be explored in the overview plot (Fig. 8). We discuss the
detailed evolution in
Sect. 4.2. For each simulation, we picked a
time step for which the diameter of the slab cavity is
around 6 pc
(the observed size of the Diamond Ring) and perform synthetic
observations with RADMC-3D
(Dullemond et al. 2012) of the
158 µm [C II] line. The RADMC-3D routine creates a PPV-cube
with a
velocity range from −30 km s−1 to 30 km s−1 and a reso-
lution of 0.1 km s−1.
To make a direct
comparison with the observations of the Di-
amond Ring, we resampled the PPV-cubes to 0.3 km s−1 and
spatially smooth with a Gaussian beam of 15′′. For the moment-
0 and moment-1 maps, we applied a
noise mask based on
the integrated intensity noise level of the full cube, Irms =

Nch=4.45 K
km s−1, where rmsch = 1.05 K is the
channel-wise rms noise present in our SOFIA observations at
0.3
km s−1 resolution. Based on this noise level, we applied a 2σ
cut; however, note here that no low-
intensity central emission is
visible, even up to 1.6σ. The structure is viewed with a tilt of 34◦,
with the viewing angle determined by fitting an ellipse to the Di-
amond Ring as shown in Appendix
B. The resulting moment-0
and moment-1 maps are shown in Fig. 7 and their comparison to
the
observations will be discussed in the next section.

√

4. The evolution of the Diamond Ring

4.1.
Observational scenario

For the B0.5e star close to the centre of the Diamond Ring,
we would expect
moderate mass-loss rates and a lower terminal
wind velocity compared to more massive O-type stars.
Neverthe-
less, the thermal pressure of the ionising radiation and thermali-
sation of the wind’s
kinetic energy is expected to create a warm
(∼8000 K) bubble of ionised gas that drives expansion
veloci-
ties of 1-10 km s−1, consistent with previously observed [C II]
shell velocities (Pabst et
al. 2019; Luisi et al. 2021). Here, we
argue that the Diamond Ring initially formed in a slab of
gas.
After an initial expansion driven by the pressure of the H II re-
gion, the shell will break
out at the bottom and top of the slab
and ionised gas will escape into the lower density
environment.
The radial expansion in the plane of the slab will continue to
be driven by the
momentum impacted by the ionised gas. As it
sweeps up more and more mass, the velocity of this
radial ex-
pansion will decrease. The ionising feedback of the star creates
a bipolar outflow
perpendicular to the layer and a shock front
sweeps up molecular gas within the layer, forming a
dense ring
confined to the plane of the molecular slab. The 24 µm emis-
sion (Fig. 2 a) centrally
peaks at the position of star #227, while
the cm emission (Fig. 2 c) is brighter to the east of the
star.
This may reflect a dust temperature gradient driven by stellar
heating, with warmer dust near
the central star naturally produc-
ing enhanced 24 µm emission (Tielens 2005). The idea that an
H II
region (with its associated [C II] bubble) bursts out of a ‘flat’
molecular cloud or a slab is
supported by several observational
studies. For instance, bipolar H II regions have been observed in
RCW36 (Bonne et al. 2022) and the Rosette nebula (Wareing
et al. 2018), potentially driven by the
feedback of one ionizing O
star (five O-type stars in the latter case) in a molecular slab. Flat-
tened molecular cloud structures around H II regions were also
observed in the J = 3→2 line
transition of CO in the work of
Beaumont & Williams (2010). The molecular gas distribution

appears ring-like (not shell-like) in all studied objects (i.e. 43
Spitzer-
selected bubbles). A LOS CO emission deficit was also
observed in RCW120 by Kabanovic et al. (2022),
where the au-
thors argue that the observed limb-brightening effect and molec-
ular line widths
cannot be reproduced by a spherically symmet-
ric molecular cloud. Moreover, the initial structure
of the as-
sociated molecular cloud must have been flat. Schneider et al.
(2023) showed that low
surface brightness [C II] intensity in the
Cygnus X region (including the DR21 ridge, the W75N star-
forming regions, and the Diamond Ring area) arises from CO-
dark molecular and atomic gas. The
observed intensities can be
explained by interacting flows of gas that have a filamentary or
slab-
like geometry. When combined with slightly higher density
pre-existing molecular clumps and the
filamentary connection
to the DR21 ridge in the north-west, this scenario provides a
plausible
explanation for the observed patchy CO emission. In
addition, in the SILCC-Zoom simulations
presented in Ganguly
et al. (2023), molecular clouds exhibit predominantly sheet-like
morphologies,
with spheroidal structures being rare. In our sim-
plified simulation set-up, we did not try to
reproduce the global
dynamics of the gas; therefore, we could not accurately predict
the physical
properties of molecular gas outside the reach of the
ring.

4.2. Simulation scenario

Comparing the
observed intensities and dynamics with the sim-
ulations enabled us to better constrain the
parameter space in
our scenario. We find that a slab with 2.0 pc thickness and a
hydrogen density of
nH=350 cm−3 gives the best match, as illus-
trated in the moment-maps of Fig. 7, obtained from the
original
simulations displayed in Fig. 8. Simulations with thinner slabs
(e.g. 1 pc) compress the
SUR gas into a small region. The high-
density gas then forms CO and has a lower C+ fraction. This
is
incompatible with the DR, because the [C II] intensities are too
low and CO would be detectable
in the SUR. Simulations with
thicker slabs (e.g. 2.5 pc and 3 pc) show a different morphology
in the
moment maps. Multiple overlaying rings are visible and
the central void tapers to a point at the
ends of the long axis. The
intensity at these two points is also strongly increased.

Based on Fig.
8, we can explain the evolution of the best-
fit simulation. The H II region is initially confined
to the slab
and evolves according to the analytical solution by Hosokawa
& Inutsuka (2006) (see Eq.
1). Then, at around 100 kyr, it breaks
out of the slab and produces an outflow led by two half
shells.
In the second snapshot, the outflowing gas is more diffuse and
fully photo-ionised and the
ionising radiation escapes in a bipo-
lar ‘champagne flow’ (Tenorio-Tagle 1979). At this stage, the
ex-
pansion of the H II region into the slab transitions to the scenario
analysed by Whitworth et
al. (2022) of a star eroding a molecu-
lar slab. An inwardly directed photo-evaporation flow
develops,
which (due to the conservation of momentum) must accelerate
the SUR outwards. This effect
is known as the ‘rocket effect’,
first proposed by Oort (1954). Thus, even though the pressure in
the bubble decreases and, along with it, its acceleration on the
SUR, the ‘rocket effect’ leads to a
continued expansion. The last
snapshot shows the simulation at the time the SUR reaches the
size of
the DR with a diameter of 6 pc. The two half shells have
left thedisplayed area, but are still
inside of the elongated simu-
lation box. The direction from which the DR is observed from is
indicated in the first and the third panel. The stellar wind creates
an elongated bubble that
expands primarily along the direction
of the outflow. The bubble is filled with very hot (T > 107
K),
low-density (n < 10−2 cm−3) gas. At this stage, the SUR con-

S. Dannhauer: The Diamond Ring in

tains about 0.5 M⊙ of C+ and has a mean number density of
nSUR ∼ 3000 cm−3. Figure 9 shows
the evolution of the SUR ra-
dius and its radial velocity. We selected the gas within the SUR
by
applying a density threshold of twice the initial slab density
and filtering for a positive radial
gas velocity. We put the simula-
tion results into perspective by comparing the size and velocity
evolution with two analytical models, which describe the expan-
sion of an H II region for two
different set-ups, but which do not
include the effects of stellar winds. In the first phase, the
expan-
sion of the ionisation front (IF) follows the solution of an H II
region expanding in a
uniform medium,

which was derived by Hosokawa & Inutsuka (2006) from the
equation of motion of the shell. Here,
RSt is the Strömgren ra-
dius and CHII the isothermal sound speed of the ionised gas. At
around 150
kyr, the region transforms into a bipolar H II region,
for which Whitworth et al. (2022) derived the
expansion rate of
the IF, expressed as

with Z being the slab thickness and nH2 the H2 number den-
sity of the slab, which is assumed to be
fully molecular. There-
fore, the H2 number density in Equation 2 is related to the total
hydrogen
number densities used in our simulations simply by
= 0.5 nH. By taking the time derivative of both
equations,
nH2
we find that the velocities with which the IF expands scale as
˙Ri,HI(t) ∝ t−3/7, for
t ≫ tdyn = RSt/CHII, and ˙Ri,Wh(t) ∝ t−1/3. The
expansion velocity in the Hosokawa & Inutsuka (2006)
solution
decreases more slowly so that a larger expansion velocity can be
sustained for longer. We
note that while ˙Ri is the velocity of the
IF and not the gas velocity of the gas in the SUR, they
are ap-
proximately equal. This is because, compared to the mass in the
SUR, only a small amount of
gas gets ionised and flows into the
H II region. We find that the stellar wind does not
significantly af-
fect the size and velocity of the SUR and only increases its radial
momentum by
1.6 %.

In our simulation set-up, the expansion is slowly decreas-
ing with diameter after the
initial breakout. The expanding ring
reaches a diameter of size ∼6 pc after 400 − 500 kyr (Fig. 9),
earlier than the classical age estimates that assume spherical
symmetry. Furthermore, the velocity
dispersion and the order of
magnitude of the pressure of the H II region are reproduced by
our
simple simulation picture (Fig. 8 and Fig. A.2).

The most notable distinction between observations
and sim-
ulations is the difference in the [C II] integrated intensity. We as-
sume that the higher
[C II] intensities in the northeastern part of
the ring are driven by mass infall via filaments on
the clump
containing protostars, creating a more massive PDR compared
to the rest of the ring.
Excluding this region and considering the
observational noise for the synthetic observations, the
integrated
intensities are a good match. Small differences of lower intensi-
ties (∼30% decrease) in
our simulations can arise due to clumpi-
ness and also from the limited numerical resolution at the
po-
sition of the PDR (Franeck et al. 2018). In general, introducing
clumpiness can increase the [C
II] emission because FUV pho-
tons would penetrate further into the ISM through low-density

channels. A clumpy PDR would give a larger
surface area, result-
ing in broadened layering within the PDR (see e.g. (Röllig, M. &
Ossenkopf-
Okada, V. 2022)). For the simulations, we expect our
FUV approximation at the PDR to be quite
precise. For our set-
up a substantial boost of the [C II] line intensity from a clumpy
medium is
unlikely because with a low average AV,3D ∼ 0.44 in
the PDR and a mean density of nSUR ∼ 3000 cm−3,
we are al-
ready above the critical density and the upper level population
is saturated (see e.g.,
appendix in Bisbas et al. (2022)). Both an-
alytical models, namely, those of Hosokawa & Inutsuka
(2006)
and Whitworth et al. (2022) and ours, predict gas expansion ve-
locities of ∼4 km s−1, which
is a factor of 2 higher than deter-
mined from the observed LOS velocity difference and the ellipse
fit. Such discrepancies are not unexpected in an idealised set-up
and we suggest two possible
explanations that may help recon-
cile the tension. One possibility is the influence of a magnetic
field, which was not included in our simulations. A field oriented
perpendicular to the slab would
slow down the radial expansion
(Arthur et al. 2011). For our configuration, a plausible magnetic
field strength of ∼ 40 µG (Crutcher et al. 2010) would yield a
magnetic pressure comparable to the
thermal pressure of the H II
region at t = 400 kyr, thereby substantially reducing the expan-
sion
rate. The second possible explanation is that in our uniform
model, we do not model the dense core
in which the star would
have originally formed. The core would provide additional gas
mass which the
feedback needs to accelerate, thereby also slow-
ing down the expansion.

The slab thickness is
probably the most important parame-
ter that influences the simulations: A larger slab thickness in-

creases
the [C II] intensity and the width of the ring along the
minor axis (because there is a larger
projected ionising front),
while keeping the density constant. Furthermore, increasing the
slab
thickness alters the geometry, making it more bubble-like
rather than purely ring-like. As a result,
material located closer
to the central star in projection can contribute to the LOS veloc-
ity,
leading to the observation of higher velocities. We find that
slab thicknesses up to 2.5 pc
reproduce well the observed veloc-
ity structure (Fig. 7). Based on the noise-level in our observa-
tions, we know that we are sensitive from NCII = 3.5 · 1016 cm−2
upward in our moment-0 map (Fig.6).
Applying such a thresh-
old to our observations, it becomes clear that the free-streaming
high-
velocity+low-density gas component along the LOS in the
simulations is below our detection limit,
giving rise to the starkly
ring-like appearance.

4.3. Timescales

We observed a mismatch between
the age estimates of around
2 Myr of the H II region derived from the simulations of Trem-
blin et
al. (2014), described in Appendix D, and the dynamical
age estimate (upper limit), respectively,
along with the first ap-
pearance of a ring of [C II] emission in our simulations (typi-
cally
around 100 kyr, depending on model set-up). In Tremblin
et al. (2014), the pressure in the bubble
would constantly de-
crease with r−3/2 for most of its evolution as long as the pressure
of the
ionised gas is higher than the pressure of its surrounding
medium, in which it is confined. This
leads to an over-estimation
of the H II region age by a factor of ∼ 5 − 6 based on gas pressure
for
evolved regions in flat molecular clouds. Our findings of bub-
ble destruction starting in the first
few 100 kyr are in line with
timescales on which cloud dispersion starts to destroy the bub-
ble
geometry (Bonne, L. et al. 2023) and well below the expected
life time of a B0-type star of ∼10 Myr.
Introducing clumpiness
into the molecular slab could further tighten or relax the tension
(Walch et
al. 2012). For example, a high fractal dimension would
lead to photons leak into the thinner parts
and a faster advance
of the H II region in certain regions, with pillars protruding into
the H II
region. This would further decrease the age at which the
ring reaches the observed physical size.
The fact that we observe
a slow radial expansions and no pillars, however, hints at a low
initial
clumpiness in the molecular slab around the ring.

5. Summary & conclusions

In this study, we
present the first detection of an apparent ring
of [C II] emission, called the Diamond Ring, in the
Cygnus X
region that shows only a slow radial expansion of ∼1.3 km s−1
in the plane of the sky. The
Diamond Ring does not display the
3D shell structure typically observed in other [C II] bubbles.
initially formed within a ∼2 pc thick slab with a density of
∼350 cm−3. The parts of the shell
moving perpendicular to the
slab get rapidly diluted in the lower-density surroundings, so
that only
the slowly expanding ring remains detectable, which is
confined by the swept-up gas in the slab
plane.

• From the simulations,
the age of the Diamond Ring is
determined to be around 425 kyr, with
a bubble-like expansion
only in the first 100 kyr. This is in tension with the commonly
employed
dynamical age estimate assuming a constant ex-
pansion velocity and with H II region age estimates
based on
turbulent pressure simulations (both methods arrive at ∼2 Myrs).

In summary, we propose we
have detected the terminal
phase of evolution for expanding [C II] bubbles within flat
molecular
clouds or slabs driven by thermal pressure and stellar
winds. This study offers insights into how
stellar feedback of
a massive star impacts the dynamics of the gas in slab-like
molecular
environments, which are likely to be more common
in star-forming regions than the idealised
spherical expansion
scenarios that are typically modelled.

Appendix A: Complementary
plots

Figure A.1 displays three position-velocity cuts of the [C II]
emission of the Diamond Ring.
The vertical, horizontal, and in-
clined cuts correspond to the fitted semi minor-axis shown in
Fig.
6. None of the cuts show an arc-like emission distribution
as it was detected in other sources, such
as RCW120 Luisi et al.
(2021), where it is attributed to an expanding [C II] shell with
expansion
velocities of >10 km s−1. For the Diamond Ring, the
bulk emission shows a linear relation with a
slow gradient that
increases with redshifted emission, suggesting a LOS velocity
difference of ∼1.5
km s−1, also visible in Fig. 6. This linear
relation suggests the expansion of a ring, instead of a
three-
dimensional shell. In Appendix B, we demonstrate that this ve-
locity difference is
associated with a radial expansion velocity
assuming a tilted ring. Figure A.2 shows the moment-2
map (ve-
locity dispersion) of the [C II] emission with the same ellipse
overlaid as in Fig. 6.
Appendix B: Determination of tilt angle and

expansion velocity of the ring

(cid:16) b
a

The
relative LOS, ∆vLOS , of the expansion velocity vrad is given
by ∆vLOS = 2vrad sin (φ). The factor
two arises due to us ob-
serving a total velocity difference, so the difference between the
approaching and receding parts of the ring and the angle corre-
sponds to the tilt between the plane
of the slab and the plane on
the sky. If a circular ring is projected onto the sky as an ellipse
due
to an inclination, this angle is related to the semi-minor axis
(cid:17)
b and semi-major axis a of
an ellipse by φ = arccos
. An el-
lipse, accounting for rotation within the plane of sky based on
the moment-1 map, was fitted to the crest of the [C II] emission
(assuming a Gaussian emission
profile over the ring thickness)
at a velocity of −2.1 km s−1. This velocity corresponds to the
maximum emission, as determined by a Gaussian fit to the av-
erage spectra over the Diamond Ring and
the ring-like appear-
ance is not affected by the SW filament (Fig. 3, left panel). A
S /N ≥ 5
threshold was applied for fitting. The centre of the
ellipse is at RA(2000)=20h37m56s and
Dec(2000)=42◦11′00′′,
approximately 80′′ separated from star #227. The major axis of
the ellipse is
inclined by an angle of 29.6◦ counter-clockwise
with respect to the north direction. This rotation,
based on the
observed rotation in the moment-1 map, was kept fixed for fit-
ting. The semi-axes have
lengths of b=2.55 pc and a=3.08 pc at a
distance of 1.5 kpc. This gives a tilt angle of φ = 34◦ ±17◦
for the
ring rotation. Here, we assumed an error of 0.4 pc on the axes,
which corresponds to roughly
half the ring width. The resulting
ellipse, overlaid on the [C II] moment-1 map, is shown in Fig. 6.
We determined a LOS velocity difference across the minor axis
of the ellipse of ∆vLOS =1.5 km s−1
from the associated PV-cut,
where we assumed an error of 0.2 km s−1. With the equations
above, and
the associated conservative error estimates, this leads
to a low radial expansion velocity of vrad =
1.3 ± 0.6 km s−1.
This approach assumes a ring-like geometric structure, whereas,
in reality,
natural deviations are expected due to expansion into
a medium that is never perfectly uniform.
Appendix C: Ionising source of the associated H II

region of the Diamond Ring

nebula and its
subsequent expansion. This is confirmed by its
H- and K-band spectrum (Fig C.1), which is dominated
by the
Brackett series of hydrogen in both the H and K bands. In addi-
tion, the HeI line at 1.7 µm,
which quickly decreases in strength
with decreasing stellar temperature in main sequence stars, is
well visible, which suggests a very early B spectral type. On the
other hand, we do not detect any
HeII features in either the H
or the K band, which rules out an O-type. In the K band the
HeI
feature at 2.112 µm is also visible, but the most promi-
nent is the Brackett-γ line, which shows a
prominent emission
at its core. We find a spectral type B0.5e as the best match for
this star. The
photometry is well consistent with this classifi-
cation and the adopted distance of 1.5 kpc; Gaia
DR3 yields
GBP − GRP = 3.31, translating into a visual extinction Av =
8.9 using the relations in
Wang & Chen (2019) and an intrinsic
colour (GBP − GRP)0 = −0.45. This is similar to the extinction
Av=9.9 in its direction derived from the Herschel column den-
sity maps (Schneider et al. 2016). The
absolute magnitude of the
star is thus MRP = −3.7, or MV = −4.0 using the photometric
system
transformations of Carrasco et al. (2016), see also GAIA
DR3 documentation. This places the star
very near the O9.5-B0
border, with the caveat that the photometry may be affected by
undetected
binarity frequently found among massive stars.

Appendix D: Derivation of physical properties of
the Diamond Ring

Column density and mass from [C II]
For the derivation of the [C II] column
density (NCII), we can pre-
sume an optically thin τ ≪ 1 line because the [C II] line profiles
are
mostly Gaussian and do not show self-absorption features, as
frequently observed in dense and warm
PDRs (Kabanovic et al.
2022). We use the equation from Goldsmith et al. (2012):

NCII =

.

(D.1)
We took a kinetic temperature of Tkin=100 K and a density
n5 after the simulations) of 1000 cm−3,
based on PDR mod-
eling, using the PDR toolbox and the WK2020 model (Pound
& Wolfire 2008) of
regions within the Diamond Ring. For this
modeling, we employed the [C II] data presented in this
study
and additional SOFIA observations of the CO 8→7 line and
the [O I] 145 µm line (to be
presented in future publication).
The de-excitation rate coefficient of atomic hydrogen is given
by
Rul = 7.6 · 10−19 (Tkin/100K)0.14 cm3s−1, which translates to
a collisional de-excitation rate of
Cul = n × Rul. The calculated
column density is then translated to a total mass by

Mgas = NCII

with a carbon to hydrogen ratio C/H = 1.6 · 10−4 (Sofia et al.
2004), a mean atomic

A of the ring. The latter was determined by performing a
Dendrogram (Rosolowsky et al. 2008) analysis on the integrated
emission map from −8 to 3 km s−1 and
corresponds roughly to
the area within the 40 K km s−1 level displayed in Fig. 2. For the
Diamond
Ring this yields a value of NCII = 9.7 · 1017cm−2 and
a mass of ∼ 1083 M⊙ for a mean ICII of 54 K km

of 0.5 Jy has been subtracted, determined
as the mean in an
emission free region south-west of the Diamond Ring. We then
obtained a Lyman
continuum of NLy = 1.50 · 1048 s−1.

Age of the H II region
In order to estimate the age of the H II
region associated with
the Diamond Ring, we employ results from the simulations of
Tremblin et al.
(2014), which incorporate ram pressure of the
surrounding turbulent medium following Larson’s law
(Larson
1981), in which the H II region expands. They built a grid of
1D simulations to estimate the
dynamical age of the H II regions
and successfully tested their method on well-known regions for
which photometric age estimations were available. In order to
derive the ionised gas pressure of the
H II region we first calcu-
late the electron density ⟨ne⟩ following Martín-Hernández et al.

where
θD is the angular diameter of the source. We determined
an electron density ⟨ne⟩ of ∼ 86 cm−3 so
that the pressure of
the ionised gas is P = 2⟨ne⟩kBTe = 1.9 · 10−10 dyne cm−2. We
note that these
equations are valid for a thermal pressure-driven
H II region without stellar wind. With these
values, we obtain an
age of the Diamond Ring H II region of 2-2.5 Myr, using Fig. 2
of Tremblin et
al. (2014). We note that if the ionising source is
situated within a slab, and the ionised gas is
allowed to stream
freely into the lower density environment, the method overesti-
mates the age of
the region. Moreover, the simulations assume a
spherical expansion, whereas in this case, the
expansion rapidly
transitions into the snowplough phase. Here, the gas is primarily
driven by the
ram pressure of the stellar wind rather than ther-
mal pressure, as the high-pressure gas inside the
H II region can
freely escape along directions perpendicular to the slab. Conse-
quently, the
expansion velocity decreases more rapidly than in
a fully confined bubble. As a result, the actual
age of the H II
region is likely shorter than 2–2.5 Myr. Another timescale com-
monly discussed in
the context of expanding [C II] bubbles is the
dynamical timescale tdyn=2.3 Myr, which is just the
size-velocity
relation and gives an upper-limit, as it assumes a constant expan-
sion speed.

ABSTRACT
The ‘Diamond Ring’ within Cygnus X, south-west of the DR21 ridge, stands out as a prominent, nearly
circular structure in infrared
(IR) and far-infrared (FIR) emission, spanning approximately 6 pc in
diameter. It is enclosed by clumpy molecular clouds seen in
CO lines and contains an HIIregion,
visible in cm emission. It resembles a classical HIIregion associated with an expanding bubble
seen
routinely in the 158µm line of ionised carbon ([CII]). However, our recent observations utilising
the Stratospheric Observatory
for Far-Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) under the FEEDBACK program for the
spectrally resolved [CII] line have revealed a slightly
tilted ring with a mass of∼103M⊙, advancing
at a velocity of∼1.3 km s−1. The bulk emission of the gas has a line-of-sight (LOS)
velocity
around−2 km s−1. The [CII] data revealed that the ‘Diamond’ of the Diamond Ring is an unrelated,
dense gas clump at a
LOS velocity of∼7 km s−1. The driving source, which is also responsible for
powering the associated HIIregion, is a B0.5e star,
classified by our IR spectroscopy. This
observation marks the first instance where we observe only a slowly expanding ring of [CII]
emission
and not an expanding 3D shell. We suggest that the HIIregion (along with its associated [CII]
bubble), initially formed by a
massive star, expanded outwards from a flat slab of molecular gas
nearly in the plane of the sky. Presently, the [CII] ring is confined
by the swept-up gas of the
slab, while the parts of the shell moving in the directions perpendicular to the shell along the LOS
have
dissipated, resulting in a notable decrease in the expansion of the remaining ring. This
scenario is supported by dedicated simulations
that trace the evolution of the [CII] bubble. Our
observations support the scenario of HIIregion evolution in ‘flat’ molecular clouds,
reported
earlier in the literature. In this geometry, we propose that the Diamond Ring represents the
terminal phase of an expanding
[CII] bubble driven by stellar winds and thermal pressure.

1. Introduction
The radiation and stellar winds emitted by OB stars
inject sub-
stantial radiative, thermal, and mechanical energy into the inter-
stellar medium (ISM).
In recent years, a highly effective method
for quantifying stellar feedback has been to utilise the
fine-
structure line of ionised carbon ([CII]) at 158µm because it
probes photo-dissociated regions
(PDRs), where far-ultraviolet
(FUV) photons predominantly determine the physical and chem-
ical
properties of the gas (Hollenbach & Tielens 1999). Notably,
observations conducted with the
Stratospheric Observatory for
Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) have enabled velocity-resolved
mapping of
[CII] around HIIregions, revealing the presence ofradially expanding [CII] shells (Pabst et al.
2019; Luisi et al.
2021; Tiwari et al. 2021; Beuther et al. 2022; Bonne et al. 2022).
They are most
visible as high-velocity red- or blueshifted emis-
sion in [CII] spectra and display an ellipse in
position-velocity
(PV) cuts. The maximum expansion velocities along the line-of-
sight (LOS) in the
central part of the bubble typically surpass
the sound speed of approximately 10 km s−1,
characteristic of
photo-ionised gas. This led to the conclusion that the [CII] bub-
bles are
predominantly driven by the stellar winds of the excit-
ing OB star(s), as depicted in analytical
models (Weaver et al.
1977). Lower expansion velocities of evolved [CII] shells have
also been
observed in Orion (Pabst et al. 2020). However, only
recently, Keilmann et al. (2025) detected a
very young [CII] bub-

Fig. 1: Overview of the northern Cygnus X region. The three
colour image displaysHerschel70µm (blue), 160µm (green),
and 250µm (red) emission (Schneider et al.
2016). The 70 and
160µm emissions indicate the distribution of hot dust while the
250µm trace the
cooler dust mostly associated with molecular
gas. The main objects are labelled in yellow, the
filament nota-
tion stems from Hennemann et al. (2012). The B star #227 is
indicated with a black
star symbol. The ‘Diamond’ of the Dia-
mond Ring is Cl 13 (Le Duigou & Knödlseder 2002). The [CII]
mapping covers the DR21 ridge and the Diamond Ring (Schnei-
der et al. 2023; Bonne et al. 2023).
Here, we focus on the area

ble characterised by a small compact
HIIregion and an extended,
slowly expanding (∼2.6 km s−1) [CII] shell.
We report the first detection
of a distinct ring1of [CII] emis-
sion within the Cygnus X region that is devoid of any spherical
shell-like configuration, but displaying, in fact, a radial expan-
sion in the plane of the sky
at∼1.3 km s−1. This feature cor-
responds to the ‘Diamond Ring’ (Marston et al. 2004), situated
south-west of the DR21 ridge (Schneider et al. 2010), cf. theHer-
schelmap displayed in Fig. 1. The
whole area forms a complex
network of clouds and filaments, hypothesised to result from
the
interaction of predominantly atomic flows (Schneider et al.
2023). All western filaments, in
particular, filament SW (nota-
tion from Hennemann et al. (2012)), reveal a connection to the
ring.
The Diamond Ring (or at least parts of it) is also conspic-
uous in the near- and mid-infrared (NIR-
MIR) (Marston et al.
2004; Beerer et al. 2010; Kryukova et al. 2014). In Fig. 2 a and
b, we map
theSpitzer24 and 8µm data. It is also discernible in
CO transitions (see Fig. 2 d) and the [CII]
line (Schneider et al.
1We observe a ring as a projected structure on the sky. As we will
demonstrate later, the parental molecular cloud likely exhibits a slab-
like morphology.
Consequently, in three-dimensional space, the overall
geometry is best described as a toroidal
structure.2023).
The nearby Cyg OB2 association with 169 O stars (Wright et al.
2015) illuminates
the entire complex. The Diamond Ring itself
is associated with an HIIregion that fills the cavity
(Lockman
1989; Kuchar & Clark 1997) with its exciting source most plau-
sibly being star #227 from
Comerón et al. (2008). A NIR spec-
troscopy study for of this star is also presented in the present
paper. Figure 2 c shows a map taken at 4.88 GHz (6 cm), where
it becomes obvious that the ionised
gas fills the Diamond Ring,
with stronger emission in the eastern part. This could be due to
a
density gradient within the HIIregion and radiation leakage
from the embedded cluster located in the
eastern clump within
the Diamond ring. The protostellar sources within this clump
(Kryukova et al.
2014) are well visible in the 24µm image in
Fig. 2 a).
The Diamond Ring has the same velocity as the
molecular clouds
associated with the DR21 ridge at∼−2 km s−1in the Cygnus X
North region, so we
adopted a distance of 1.5 kpc (Rygl et al.
2012). Here, we demonstrate that the ‘Diamond’ component
of
the Diamond Ring in the south-east, containing a cluster of B
stars referred to as Cl 13 in Le
Duigou & Knödlseder (2002) or
cluster 16 in Dutra & Bica (2001), is a LOS feature unrelated
to the
ring at a velocity of around+7 km s−1. The objective of
this paper is to understand how this
peculiar [CII] ring has been
formed and how it evolves. To achieve this aim, we use [CII]
data from
the SOFIA legacy program FEEDBACK (Schneider
et al. 2020), along with archival molecular line, dust
continuum
and radio data, and new optical observations of star #227. The
SOFIA and optical
observations are described in Sect. 2. All data
sets are presented and analysed in Sect. 3. We also
performed a
dedicated 3D simulation, informed by observational parameters,
where the radiation and
stellar wind of a massive star erode a
slab of gas (Sect. 4). In Sect. 4, we also develop a physical
sce-
nario for the Diamond Ring and discuss the observed timescales.
Section 5 summarises the paper.
2. Observations
2.1. SOFIA
The Diamond Ring was mapped as part of a large-scale mapping
of the
Cygnus X north region within the SOFIA FEEDBACK
legacy program.2The [CII] 158µm line was observed
using the
upGREAT receiver (Risacher et al. 2018). The half-power beam
width at 158µm is 14.′′1 and
the typical main beam efficiency
is approximately 0.65. We use data that we spatially smoothed
to
angular resolutions of 20′′, on a Nyquist sampled 8′′grid, and
15′′in a 5′′grid. The 20′′spectra
were resampled to a velocity
resolution of 0.3 km s−1and 1 km s−1and have an average rms
baseline
noise of 0.8 K and 0.5 K at these velocity resolutions.
At 15′′angular resolution the average rms
baseline is 1.05 K at
0.3 km s−1velocity resolution. For further technical details, we
refer to
Schneider et al. (2020, 2023) and Bonne et al. (2023).
2.2. Spectroscopy with the Nordic Optical
Telescope
Spectroscopy of star #227 was obtained on the night of 27 and
28 June 2024 with the NIR
camera and spectrograph NOTCam
at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) at La Palma, Spain. Two
separate settings were used, covering the H band (1.48-1.78µm)
and the K band (1.95-2.36µm). The
slit used had a width of 0′′6,

providing a
resolutionλ/∆λ=2500. The star was moved along
the slit using an ABBA pattern and in each position, a
set of ten
exposures of 4 s was obtained in each filter. The exposure time
was thus 160 s in each
filter, which was sufficient to obtain a
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 80 in the H band and 170 in
the K
band, respectively. A correction of telluric features was achieved
by dividing the spectra of
star #227 by that of the nearby B8V
star HD 194670 subsequently observed at the same airmass.
2.3.
Complementary data
We used12CO and13CO 1→0 data from the Nobeyama 45m
telescope Cygnus survey,
described in detail in Yamagishi et al.
(2018) and Takekoshi et al. (2019). The original angular
reso-
lution is 16′′and the velocity resolution 0.25 km s−1; however,
for the purposes of this
study, we used data smoothed to 20′′resolution in a 8′′grid. In addition, we employed 8µm and 24
µm
data at 1.9′′and 2.55′′angular resolution, respectively, from
theSpitzerCygnus X legacy survey
(Kryukova et al. 2014) and
FIR continuum images fromHerschel, shown in Schneider et al.
(2016).
Finally, we also made use of radio continuum data at 4.88
GHz from the GLOSTAR (Brunthaler et al.
2021; Gong et al.
2023) survey, which combines data taken at the Effelsberg 100m
telescope and the
VLA. For technical details, we refer to these
papers. Here, we use an Effelsberg-only map with a
resolution
of 145′′.

ity structure, with emission originating from previously identi-
fied molecular cloud complexes in
Cygnus X (Schneider et al.
2006; Cao et al. 2019; Schneider et al. 2023). We focus on the
velocity
range from−8 to 3 km s−1, which corresponds to the
Diamond Ring. We did not detect the [13C II]
hyperfine struc-
ture components F(1-0) and F(1-1), which have velocity shifts
of−65.1 km
s−1and+63.2 km s−1, respectively, relative to the
bulk emission at−2 km s−1. The F(2-1) component
has a veloc-
ity shift of 11.3 km s−1and, thus, it would be expected to appear
around 7 km s−1. This
makes the line difficult to detect because
of the bulk emission of the Diamond with Cl 13 at that
velocity.

identified as Cl 13 in
Le Duigou & Knödlseder (2002), is detached from the ring
in velocity space,
with its bulk emission centred at 7 km s−1.
The peak of the [CII] emission originates from a clump
located
east of star #227, which exhibits a protrusion extending toward
this source. The clump
contains four protostellar objects with
luminosities above 10 L ⊙(Kryukova et al. 2014). We note
that
the CO (1→0) emission (Figs. 2 d) and 3) is very fragmented at
all velocities and does not form
a coherent ring-structure, as we
see in [CII]. Moreover, the CO emission appears to wrap around
the
[CII] emission and the ring. The channel maps (Fig. 3) show
that at−2 km s−1, the SW filament (Fig.
1) is clearly observed
in CO (while more diffuse in [CII]), while at 7 km s−1, the
molecular cloud
associated with Cl 13 becomes prominent.
The most important aspect to consider here is the lack of
sig-
nificant blue- or redshifted [CII] emission in the centre of the
ring at high velocities (at
least a few km s−1away from the bulk
emission), which is typically associated with the 3D expansion
of a radiation or wind-blown bubble (see references in Sect.1).
Our 1σdetection limit is 0.52 K km
s−1in the channel map of
Fig. 3 and 1.94 K km s−1for the line-integrated (−8 to 3 km s−1)
[CII] map.
The noise level in the channel map corresponds to a
typical [CII] column density of N
CII=9.4·1015cm−2(follow-
ing the equations presented later). A possible [CII] shell, how-
ever,
would only be visible at high red- and blueshifted veloci-
ties and would cover a smaller velocity
range (not including the
bulk emission). Typical line widths of expanding [CII] shells are
around 5
km s−1(Luisi et al. 2021; Bonne, L. et al. 2023), lead-
ing to N CII=2.4·1016cm−2. We observed
slightly blueshifted
(∼−2 to−3 km s−1LOS velocity) emission in the southeast-
ern region and
redshifted (∼−1.5 to 0.5 km s−1) emission in the
northwestern region, as displayed in Fig. 6. An
increased veloc-
ity dispersion (Fig. A.2) is observed in the northeastern part of
the Diamond Ring,
where the SW filament intersects the ring.
Ram pressure caused by collision with this filament could
ex-
plain the higher velocity dispersion. However, this will be in-
vestigated in a separate study,
using recently obtained molecular
line data (Dannhauer et al., in prep.). In contrast, the higher
ve-
locity dispersion further south in the ring is likely a consequence
of enhanced turbulence
induced by stellar feedback from the in-
ternal B-type stars within the clump located east of star
#227.
The higher [CII] intensity of up to 140 K km s−1in this clump
(compared to typical values of
60-70 K km s−1in other regions
of the Diamond Ring) is most likely also caused by internal stel-
lar
feedback.
We assume that the elliptical appearance of the Diamond
Ring arises from the inclination
of the ring, which produces
the observed velocity difference between the northwestern and
southeastern regions. A sheet-like assembly of the clouds in
Cygnus X was already proposed in
Schneider et al. (2023), basedon the overall emission distribution of CO-dark gas only seen
in
[CII]. In particular the DR21 ridge was found to be formed
in such a way, demonstrated by the
typical observed V shape
in [CII]-PV cuts (Bonne et al. 2023). This scenario is further
supported by
dedicated simulations (Sect. 3.4) and discussed in
Sect. 4. A tilt angle of∼34oand a radial
expansion velocity of
∼1.3 km s−1was derived with the methodology and details pro-
vided in Appendix
B. A similar expansion velocity was obtained
from spectra and position-velocity cuts for the [CII]
bubble of
NGC 1977 in Orion, driven by a B1V star (Pabst et al. 2020).
3.2. The HIIregion and the
exciting star of the Diamond Ring
Comerón et al. (2008) identified 96 candidate massive stars in
the
outskirts of Cyg OB2 of which star #227 is the most likely
exciting source for the HIIregion
associated with the Diamond
Ring, due to its spatial location. Figure 2 shows the extent of
the
HIIregion within the cavity of the Diamond Ring in 24µm
and 6 cm free-free emission. From the
spectroscopy of the star
(details in Appendix C), we conclude that star #227 is an early-
type Be
star, most likely a Herbig B0.5e with an uncertainty of
about one spectral subclass. These
relatively young stars have
masses between 10 to 16 M ⊙.
3.3. Physical properties of the Diamond
Ring
In the following, we only give a summary of the calculated val-
ues, with further details given
in Appendix D. From the observed
line-integrated (−8 to 3 km s−1) [CII] intensities and assuming
optically thin emission3, we derived an average column [CII]
density ofN CII=9.7·1017cm−2, which
translates to a total
mass of the atomic PDR gas of 1083 M ⊙for the whole ring.
From the GLOSTAR cm-
data, we obtained the ionising flux and
determined an electron density of 86 cm−3for a temperature
of
8000 K.
By estimating the pressure of the HIIregion and comparing it to
the simulations of
HIIregions by Tremblin et al. (2014), which
account for the ram pressure of an external medium, we
obtained
the picture of an evolved HIIregion with an age of approxi-
mately 2–2.5 Myr. The upper
limit for the age of the associated
[CII] ring is given by the dynamical timescale inferred from the
expansion velocity, assumed to be constant over time, yielding
tdyn∼2.2 Myr. In Sect. 4.3, we
discuss how these commonly
employed age estimates overestimate the age of the observed
structure by
not accounting for the effect of the environment on
the evolution.
3.4. Simulating stellar feedback
in a slab of gas
The observations discussed in Sect. 3 reveal an expanding ring
of gas traced by the
[CII] emission line, without evidence of a 3D
bubble structure typically observed and reported in
the literature.
This configuration may arise when a star evolves within a ‘flat’
molecular cloud, as
proposed by Beaumont & Williams (2010).
To show that such a geometry, combined with stellar feedback
effects of a B0.5 star, can explain the observed structure, we per-
formed dedicated simulations.
For that purpose, we placed such
a star in a slab of gas with varying slab thicknesses and initial
densities and conducted simulations with ionising radiation and
with and without stellar wind.
Trying to use the simplest model
3We found no indications for a high optical depth or self-absorbed
[CII] line in the DR as it was observed in other PDRs (Kabanovic et al.
2022).

that reproduces key
observables, we chose to neglect magnetic
fields and turbulence. In Fig. 7, we present synthetic
[CII] obser-
vations of the simulation that offer the best match to the obser-
vations, but first we
begin with a description of the simulation
set-up.
We performed 3D hydrodynamics simulations with
the Eu-
lerian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code Flash4 (Fryxell
et al. 2000). The standard
piecewise parabolic method (PPM)
was used to solve the Euler equations. Self-gravity was cal-
culated using the Octtree-based solver described in Wünsch
et al. (2018). The same solver was used
to calculate the lo-
cal attenuation of the FUV radiation for every cell with the
TreeRay/OpticalDepthmodule. The radiative transport equa-
tion for extreme ultraviolet radiation
(EUV) was solved with theTreeRay/OnTheSpotmodule (Wünsch et al. 2021), which uses
the on-the-spot
approximation in combination with a backwards
ray-tracing method. It also utilises the underlying
tree structure
to make the computation more efficient. As multipole acceptance
criterion (MAC) for
all TreeRaymodules, we used a simple ge-
ometric MAC (Barnes & Hut 1986), which accepts a node if
its angular size is smaller than a chosen limit angle, and set
θlim=0.25 rad (see Wünsch et al.
(2018, 2021) for more de-
tails). We used the chemical network originally implemented in
Glover &
Mac Low (2007a,b) and extended it in Glover et al.
(2010) to the network of Nelson & Langer (1999).
The imple-
mentation in Flash4 was presented in Walch et al. (2015) and
it has since been updated by
Mackey et al. (2019) and Gaches
et al. (2023). The network follows the abundances of 32 species.

The full non-equilibrium evolution was followed for 19 species:

O+, OH, H 2O, CO, C 2, O2,
HCO+, CH, CH 2, and CH+

2. The
ionising
radiation was coupled to the chemistry network, from which the
heating and cooling terms
were calculated (Haid et al. 2018).
The stellar properties were obtained from the stellar tracks of
Ekström et al. (2012) (hereafter, ‘Geneva tracks’). The termi-
nal wind velocities were not given in
the tracks; therefore, they
were calculated according to the procedure described in Gatto
et al.
(2017). FUV radiation is treated ‘adaptively’ as described
in Rathjen et al. (2025) with some
adjustments for this simula-
tion set-up. Instead of using a constant background value, we
calculate
the FUV luminosity for each star and map the resulting
FUV radiation field onto the grid. This takes
into account that the
radiation field around each star is geometrically diluted accord-
ing to the
inverse-square law (G 0∝R−2). The FUV luminosity
of a star is calculated by integrating its spectrum
from 5.6 eV to
13.6 eV. We assumed the spectrum to be a black body with an
effective temperature
obtained from the Geneva stellar tracks. A
background field ofG bg=0.0948 (Rathjen et al. 2025) is
added
and the dust attenuation calculated by TreeRay/OpticalDepthis
applied. TreeRay/OpticalDepthwas
originally designed to sim-ulate a molecular cloud that gets irradiated from the outside by
an
isotropic background radiation field. It computes the attenu-
ation of FUV radiation as it travels
to a point, which we refer
to as the target cell, inside of the MC. The module calculates
column
densities along multiple sight lines from the perspective
of the target cell and averages them to
determine the overall at-
tenuation. In our set-up, however, the FUV radiation originates
from a
single stellar source and it is particularly important to
accurately model the FUV field at the PDR,
where most of the
[CII] emission is produced, as this determines how much carbon
is present in the
form of CO, C0, or C+. The PDR is located at
the edge of the HIIregion, where the expanding shock
continu-
ously sweeps up gas into a swept-up ring (SUR). We assumed
that the FUV radiation from the
central star is primarily attenu-
ated by the SUR itself. Therefore, we limited the path length over
which TreeRay/OpticalDepthintegrated column densities along
the sight lines to the thickness of the
SUR. Unlike the study done
by Rathjen et al. (2025), we did not limit the range of the FUV
radiation.
The set-up consisted of an elongated box with dimensions
36 pc×12 pc×12 pc filled with a
uniform diffuse gas with a
number density of n H=1 cm−3and a slab with enhanced density
located in
the y-z-plane. All gas was initialised in thermal and
chemical equilibrium. We varied the slab
thickness using values
of 1 pc, 2 pc, 2.5 pc, and 3 pc and the slab number density using
values of n
H=167 cm−3, 250 cm−3, 350 cm−3, and 500 cm−3.
The density range was motivated by the study by
Schneider et al.
(2023), where it was shown that molecular clouds built up by the
interaction of
atomic (number density of at least 100 cm−3) and
molecular flows at a temperature of∼100 K.
The
carbon abundance is set to C/H=1.6·10−4(Sofia et al.
2004). All carbon is initialised in the form of
C+, which is
close to the chemical equilibrium state for all initial densities.
The slab consists of
mostly H 2with number fractions of above
H2/H=0.495 and temperatures ofT≈100 K, where the
exact
equilibrium abundances and temperatures depend on the
slab density. The diffuse surrounding gas has
a temperature of
T=814.5 K and consists of mostly atomic hydrogen with small
H2/H=7·10−3and
HII/H=1·10−7number fractions. We
used the AMR technique (Fryxell et al. 2000) to refine the grid
at
the position of cells with more than twice the initial slab den-
sity, ensuring that the dense and
shocked material at the edge of
the HIIregion in the SUR was optimally resolved. The base grid
has a
resolution ofdx=12 pc/128≈0.094 pc and the highest
resolution level corresponds todx=12 pc/512≈0.023
pc.
Att=0,a single massive star was placed in the centre of
the slab, creating an HIIregion
initially confined by the dense

in
accordance with our observations. We simulated its ionising
radiation and stellar wind. We speculate
that this star was ei-
ther formed as a result of the interaction of gas flows (Schnei-
der et al.
2023), which built up a dense clump in which a
massive star formed, or it is a runaway star that was

intensities, morphology, dynamics, and HIIregion pressure
at a
time step when the observed and simulated [CII] rings matched
in size (with a diameter of
approximately 6 pc).
The different evolutionary stages of the expansion of the HIIre-
gion can be
explored in the overview plot (Fig. 8). We discuss the
detailed evolution in Sect. 4.2. For each
simulation, we picked a
time step for which the diameter of the slab cavity is around 6 pc
(the
observed size of the Diamond Ring) and perform synthetic
observations with RADMC-3D (Dullemond et
al. 2012) of the
158µm [CII] line. The RADMC-3D routine creates a PPV-cube
with a velocity range
from−30 km s−1to 30 km s−1and a reso-
lution of 0.1 km s−1.
To make a direct comparison with the
observations of the Di-
amond Ring, we resampled the PPV-cubes to 0.3 km s−1and
spatially smooth
with a Gaussian beam of 15′′. For the moment-
0 and moment-1 maps, we applied a noise mask based on
the integrated intensity noise level of the full cube,I rms =
rms ch∆v√Nch=4.45 K km s−1, where rms
ch=1.05 K is the
channel-wise rms noise present in our SOFIA observations at
0.3 km s−1resolution.
Based on this noise level, we applied a 2σ
cut; however, note here that no low-intensity central
emission is
visible, even up to 1.6σ. The structure is viewed with a tilt of 34◦,
with the viewing
angle determined by fitting an ellipse to the Di-
amond Ring as shown in Appendix B. The resulting
moment-0
and moment-1 maps are shown in Fig. 7 and their comparison to
the observations will be
discussed in the next section.
4. The evolution of the Diamond Ring
4.1. Observational scenario
For
the B0.5e star close to the centre of the Diamond Ring,
we would expect moderate mass-loss rates and
a lower terminal
wind velocity compared to more massive O-type stars. Neverthe-
less, the thermal
pressure of the ionising radiation and thermali-
sation of the wind’s kinetic energy is expected to
create a warm
(∼8000 K) bubble of ionised gas that drives expansion veloci-
ties of 1-10 km s−1,
consistent with previously observed [CII]
shell velocities (Pabst et al. 2019; Luisi et al. 2021).
Here, we
argue that the Diamond Ring initially formed in a slab of gas.
After an initial expansion
driven by the pressure of the HIIre-
gion, the shell will break out at the bottom and top of the
slab
and ionised gas will escape into the lower density environment.
The radial expansion in the
plane of the slab will continue to
be driven by the momentum impacted by the ionised gas. As it
sweeps up more and more mass, the velocity of this radial ex-
pansion will decrease. The ionising
feedback of the star creates
a bipolar outflow perpendicular to the layer and a shock front
sweeps
up molecular gas within the layer, forming a dense ring
confined to the plane of the molecular slab.
The 24µm emis-
sion (Fig. 2 a) centrally peaks at the position of star #227, while
the cm emission
(Fig. 2 c) is brighter to the east of the star.
This may reflect a dust temperature gradient driven
by stellar
heating, with warmer dust near the central star naturally produc-
ing enhanced 24µm
emission (Tielens 2005). The idea that an
HIIregion (with its associated [CII] bubble) bursts out of
a ‘flat’
molecular cloud or a slab is supported by several observational
studies. For instance,
bipolar HIIregions have been observed in
RCW36 (Bonne et al. 2022) and the Rosette nebula (Wareing
et al. 2018), potentially driven by the feedback of one ionizing O
star (five O-type stars in the
latter case) in a molecular slab. Flat-
tened molecular cloud structures around HIIregions were also
observed in the J=3→2 line transition of CO in the work of
Beaumont & Williams (2010). The molecular
gas distributionappears ring-like (not shell-like) in all studied objects (i.e. 43
Spitzer-selected
bubbles). A LOS CO emission deficit was also
observed in RCW120 by Kabanovic et al. (2022), where
the au-
thors argue that the observed limb-brightening effect and molec-
ular line widths cannot be
reproduced by a spherically symmet-
ric molecular cloud. Moreover, the initial structure of the as-
sociated molecular cloud must have been flat. Schneider et al.
(2023) showed that low surface
brightness [CII] intensity in the
Cygnus X region (including the DR21 ridge, the W75N star-
forming
regions, and the Diamond Ring area) arises from CO-
dark molecular and atomic gas. The observed
intensities can be
explained by interacting flows of gas that have a filamentary or
slab-like
geometry. When combined with slightly higher density
pre-existing molecular clumps and the
filamentary connection
to the DR21 ridge in the north-west, this scenario provides a
plausible
explanation for the observed patchy CO emission. In
addition, in the SILCC-Zoom simulations
presented in Ganguly
et al. (2023), molecular clouds exhibit predominantly sheet-like
morphologies,
with spheroidal structures being rare. In our sim-
plified simulation set-up, we did not try to
reproduce the global
dynamics of the gas; therefore, we could not accurately predict
the physical
properties of molecular gas outside the reach of the
ring.
4.2. Simulation scenario
Comparing the
observed intensities and dynamics with the sim-
ulations enabled us to better constrain the
parameter space in
our scenario. We find that a slab with 2.0 pc thickness and a
hydrogen density
ofn H=350 cm−3gives the best match, as illus-
trated in the moment-maps of Fig. 7, obtained from the
original
simulations displayed in Fig. 8. Simulations with thinner slabs
(e.g. 1 pc) compress the
SUR gas into a small region. The high-
density gas then forms CO and has a lower C+fraction. This is
incompatible with the DR, because the [CII] intensities are too
low and CO would be detectable in
the SUR. Simulations with
thicker slabs (e.g. 2.5 pc and 3 pc) show a different morphology
in the
moment maps. Multiple overlaying rings are visible and
the central void tapers to a point at the
ends of the long axis. The
intensity at these two points is also strongly increased.
Based on Fig.
8, we can explain the evolution of the best-
fit simulation. The HIIregion is initially confined to
the slab
and evolves according to the analytical solution by Hosokawa
& Inutsuka (2006) (see Eq. 1).
Then, at around 100 kyr, it breaks
out of the slab and produces an outflow led by two half shells.
In the second snapshot, the outflowing gas is more diffuse and
fully photo-ionised and the ionising
radiation escapes in a bipo-
lar ‘champagne flow’ (Tenorio-Tagle 1979). At this stage, the ex-
pansion of the HIIregion into the slab transitions to the scenario
analysed by Whitworth et al.
(2022) of a star eroding a molecu-
lar slab. An inwardly directed photo-evaporation flow develops,
which (due to the conservation of momentum) must accelerate
the SUR outwards. This effect is known
as the ‘rocket effect’,
first proposed by Oort (1954). Thus, even though the pressure in
the bubble
decreases and, along with it, its acceleration on the
SUR, the ‘rocket effect’ leads to a continued
expansion. The last
snapshot shows the simulation at the time the SUR reaches the
size of the DR
with a diameter of 6 pc. The two half shells have
left thedisplayed area, but are still inside of
the elongated simu-
lation box. The direction from which the DR is observed from is
indicated in the
first and the third panel. The stellar wind creates
an elongated bubble that expands primarily along
the direction
of the outflow. The bubble is filled with very hot (T>107K),
low-density (n<10−2cm−3)
gas. At this stage, the SUR con-

tains about 0.5 M ⊙of C+and has a mean number density of
nSUR∼3000 cm−3. Figure 9 shows the evolution of the SUR ra-
dius and its radial velocity. We
selected the gas within the SUR
by applying a density threshold of twice the initial slab density
and filtering for a positive radial gas velocity. We put the simula-
tion results into perspective
by comparing the size and velocity
evolution with two analytical models, which describe the expan-
sion of an HIIregion for two different set-ups, but which do not
include the effects of stellar
winds. In the first phase, the expan-
sion of the ionisation front (IF) follows the solution of an

˙Ri,HI(t)∝t−3/7, fort≫t dyn=R St/CHII, and ˙Ri,Wh(t)∝t−1/3. The
expansion velocity in the
Hosokawa & Inutsuka (2006) solution
decreases more slowly so that a larger expansion velocity can be
sustained for longer. We note that while ˙Riis the velocity of the
IF and not the gas velocity of
the gas in the SUR, they are ap-
proximately equal. This is because, compared to the mass in the
SUR, only a small amount of gas gets ionised and flows into the
HIIregion. We find that the stellar
wind does not significantly af-
fect the size and velocity of the SUR and only increases its radial
momentum by 1.6 %.
In our simulation set-up, the expansion is slowly decreas-
ing with diameter
after the initial breakout. The expanding ring
reaches a diameter of size∼6 pc after 400−500 kyr
(Fig. 9),
earlier than the classical age estimates that assume spherical
symmetry. Furthermore, the
velocity dispersion and the order of
magnitude of the pressure of the HIIregion are reproduced by
our simple simulation picture (Fig. 8 and Fig. A.2).
The most notable distinction between
observations and sim-
ulations is the difference in the [CII] integrated intensity. We as-
sume that
the higher [CII] intensities in the northeastern part of
the ring are driven by mass infall via
filaments on the clump
containing protostars, creating a more massive PDR compared
to the rest of
the ring. Excluding this region and considering the
observational noise for the synthetic
observations, the integrated
intensities are a good match. Small differences of lower intensi-
ties
(∼30% decrease) in our simulations can arise due to clumpi-
ness and also from the limited numerical
resolution at the po-
sition of the PDR (Franeck et al. 2018). In general, introducing
clumpiness
can increase the [CII] emission because FUV pho-
tons would penetrate further into the ISM through
low-density

channels. A clumpy PDR would give a larger surface area, result-
ing in broadened layering
within the PDR (see e.g. (Röllig, M. &
Ossenkopf-Okada, V . 2022)). For the simulations, we expect
our
FUV approximation at the PDR to be quite precise. For our set-
up a substantial boost of the
[CII] line intensity from a clumpy
medium is unlikely because with a low averageA V,3D∼0.44 in
the
PDR and a mean density ofn SUR∼3000 cm−3, we are al-
ready above the critical density and the upper
level population
is saturated (see e.g., appendix in Bisbas et al. (2022)). Both an-
alytical
models, namely, those of Hosokawa & Inutsuka (2006)
and Whitworth et al. (2022) and ours, predict
gas expansion ve-
locities of∼4 km s−1, which is a factor of 2 higher than deter-
mined from the
observed LOS velocity difference and the ellipse
fit. Such discrepancies are not unexpected in an
idealised set-up
and we suggest two possible explanations that may help recon-
cile the tension. One
possibility is the influence of a magnetic
field, which was not included in our simulations. A field
oriented
perpendicular to the slab would slow down the radial expansion
(Arthur et al. 2011). For
our configuration, a plausible magnetic
field strength of∼40µG (Crutcher et al. 2010) would yield a
magnetic pressure comparable to the thermal pressure of the HII
region att=400 kyr, thereby
substantially reducing the expan-
sion rate. The second possible explanation is that in our uniform
model, we do not model the dense core in which the star would
have originally formed. The core would
provide additional gas
mass which the feedback needs to accelerate, thereby also slow-
ing down the
expansion.
The slab thickness is probably the most important parame-
ter that influences the
simulations: A larger slab thickness in-

creases the [CII] intensity and the width of the ring along
the
minor axis (because there is a larger projected ionising front),
while keeping the density
constant. Furthermore, increasing the
slab thickness alters the geometry, making it more bubble-like
rather than purely ring-like. As a result, material located closer
to the central star in projection
can contribute to the LOS veloc-
ity, leading to the observation of higher velocities. We find that
slab thicknesses up to 2.5 pc reproduce well the observed veloc-
ity structure (Fig. 7). Based on
the noise-level in our observa-
tions, we know that we are sensitive fromN CII=3.5·1016cm−2
upward
in our moment-0 map (Fig.6). Applying such a thresh-
old to our observations, it becomes clear that
the free-streaming
high-velocity+low-density gas component along the LOS in the
simulations is below
our detection limit, giving rise to the starkly
ring-like appearance.
4.3. Timescales
We observed a
mismatch between the age estimates of around
2 Myr of the HIIregion derived from the simulations of
Trem-
blin et al. (2014), described in Appendix D, and the dynamical
age estimate (upper limit),
respectively, along with the first ap-
pearance of a ring of [CII] emission in our simulations
(typi-
cally around 100 kyr, depending on model set-up). In Tremblin
et al. (2014), the pressure in
the bubble would constantly de-
crease withr−3/2for most of its evolution as long as the pressure
of
the ionised gas is higher than the pressure of its surrounding
medium, in which it is confined. This
leads to an over-estimation
of the HIIregion age by a factor of∼5−6 based on gas pressure
for
evolved regions in flat molecular clouds. Our findings of bub-
ble destruction starting in the first
few 100 kyr are in line with
timescales on which cloud dispersion starts to destroy the bub-
ble
geometry (Bonne, L. et al. 2023) and well below the expected
life time of a B0-type star of∼10 Myr.
Introducing clumpiness
into the molecular slab could further tighten or relax the tension
(Walch et
al. 2012). For example, a high fractal dimension would
lead to photons leak into the thinner parts
and a faster advance
of the HIIregion in certain regions, with pillars protruding into
the
HIIregion. This would further decrease the age at which the
ring reaches the observed physical size.
The fact that we observe
a slow radial expansions and no pillars, however, hints at a low
initial
clumpiness in the molecular slab around the ring.
5. Summary & conclusions
In this study, we present
the first detection of an apparent ring
of [CII] emission, called the Diamond Ring, in the Cygnus X
region that shows only a slow radial expansion of∼1.3 km s−1
in the plane of the sky. The Diamond
Ring does not display the
3D shell structure typically observed in other [CII] bubbles.
•The ring
has an atomic mass of∼103M⊙and bulk emission at
a LOS velocity around−2 km s−1.
•The associated
HIIregion is ionised by a B0.5e star, as
determined by optical spectroscopy.
•The ‘Diamond’ in the
Diamond Ring is an unrelated
star forming gas clump at a different velocity (∼7 km s−1)
and contains
a small cluster of stars (Cl13 from Le Duigou &
Knödlseder 2002).
•Dedicated 3D simulations confirm
that the observed properties
can be best explained by a scenario in which the HIIregioninitially
formed within a∼2 pc thick slab with a density of
∼350 cm−3. The parts of the shell moving
perpendicular to the
slab get rapidly diluted in the lower-density surroundings, so
that only the
slowly expanding ring remains detectable, which is
confined by the swept-up gas in the slab plane.
•From the simulations, the age of the Diamond Ring is
determined to be around 425 kyr, with a
bubble-like expansion
only in the first 100 kyr. This is in tension with the commonly
employed
dynamical age estimate assuming a constant ex-
pansion velocity and with HIIregion age estimates
based on
turbulent pressure simulations (both methods arrive at∼2 Myrs).
In summary, we propose we
have detected the terminal
phase of evolution for expanding [CII] bubbles within flat
molecular
clouds or slabs driven by thermal pressure and stellar
winds. This study offers insights into how
stellar feedback of
a massive star impacts the dynamics of the gas in slab-like
molecular
environments, which are likely to be more common
in star-forming regions than the idealised
spherical expansion
scenarios that are typically modelled.

Appendix A: Complementary plots
Figure A.1 displays three
position-velocity cuts of the [CII]
emission of the Diamond Ring. The vertical, horizontal, and in-
clined cuts correspond to the fitted semi minor-axis shown in
Fig. 6. None of the cuts show an arc-
like emission distribution
as it was detected in other sources, such as RCW120 Luisi et al.
(2021),
where it is attributed to an expanding [CII] shell with
expansion velocities of>10 km s−1. For the
Diamond Ring, the
bulk emission shows a linear relation with a slow gradient that
increases with
redshifted emission, suggesting a LOS velocity
difference of∼1.5 km s−1, also visible in Fig. 6.
This linear
relation suggests the expansion of a ring, instead of a three-
dimensional shell. In
Appendix B, we demonstrate that this ve-
locity difference is associated with a radial expansion
velocity
assuming a tilted ring. Figure A.2 shows the moment-2 map (ve-
locity dispersion) of the
[CII] emission with the same ellipse
overlaid as in Fig. 6.
Appendix B: Determination of tilt angle
and
expansion velocity of the ring
The relative LOS,∆v LOS, of the expansion velocityv radis given
by∆v LOS=2v radsin (φ). The factor two arises due to us ob-
serving a total velocity difference, so
the difference between the
approaching and receding parts of the ring and the angle corre-
sponds to
the tilt between the plane of the slab and the plane on
the sky. If a circular ring is projected
onto the sky as an ellipse
due to an inclination, this angle is related to the semi-minor axis
band
semi-major axisaof an ellipse byφ=arccosb
a
. An el-
lipse, accounting for rotation within the
plane of sky based on
the moment-1 map, was fitted to the crest of the [CII] emission
(assuming a
Gaussian emission profile over the ring thickness)
at a velocity of−2.1 km s−1. This velocity
corresponds to the
maximum emission, as determined by a Gaussian fit to the av-
erage spectra over
the Diamond Ring and the ring-like appear-
ance is not affected by the SW filament (Fig. 3, left
panel). A
S/N≥5 threshold was applied for fitting. The centre of the
ellipse is at
RA(2000)=20h37m56sand Dec(2000)=42◦11′00′′,
approximately 80′′separated from star #227. The major
axis of
the ellipse is inclined by an angle of 29.6◦counter-clockwise
with respect to the north
direction. This rotation, based on the
observed rotation in the moment-1 map, was kept fixed for
fit-
ting. The semi-axes have lengths ofb=2.55 pc anda=3.08 pc at a
distance of 1.5 kpc. This gives
a tilt angle ofφ=34◦±17◦for the
ring rotation. Here, we assumed an error of 0.4 pc on the axes,
which corresponds to roughly half the ring width. The resulting
ellipse, overlaid on the [CII]
moment-1 map, is shown in Fig. 6.
We determined a LOS velocity difference across the minor axis
of
the ellipse of∆v LOS=1.5 km s−1from the associated PV-cut,
where we assumed an error of 0.2 km s−1.
With the equations
above, and the associated conservative error estimates, this leads
to a low
radial expansion velocity ofv rad=1.3±0.6 km s−1.
This approach assumes a ring-like geometric
structure, whereas,
in reality, natural deviations are expected due to expansion into
a medium that
is never perfectly uniform.
Appendix C: Ionising source of the associated HII
region of the Diamond
Ring
The location and photometric characteristics of star #227, at
RA(2000)=20h38m05.37s,
Dec(2000)=+42o11′14.2′′, make it
the obvious candidate to be responsible for the ionisation of
thenebula and its subsequent expansion. This is confirmed by its
H- and K-band spectrum (Fig C.1),
which is dominated by the
Brackett series of hydrogen in both the H and K bands. In addi-
tion, the
HeI line at 1.7µm, which quickly decreases in strength
with decreasing stellar temperature in main
sequence stars, is
well visible, which suggests a very early B spectral type. On the
other hand, we
do not detect any HeII features in either the H
or the K band, which rules out an O-type. In the K
band the
HeI feature at 2.112µm is also visible, but the most promi-
nent is the Brackett-γline,
which shows a prominent emission
at its core. We find a spectral type B0.5e as the best match for
this star. The photometry is well consistent with this classifi-
cation and the adopted distance of
1.5 kpc; Gaia DR3 yields
GBP−G RP=3.31, translating into a visual extinction A v=
8.9 using the
relations in Wang & Chen (2019) and an intrinsic
colour (G BP−G RP)0=−0.45. This is similar to the
extinction
Av=9.9 in its direction derived from theHerschelcolumn den-
sity maps (Schneider et al.
2016). The absolute magnitude of the
star is thusM RP=−3.7, orM V=−4.0 using the photometric
system
transformations of Carrasco et al. (2016), see also GAIA
DR3 documentation. This places the star
very near the O9.5-B0
border, with the caveat that the photometry may be affected by
undetected
binarity frequently found among massive stars.
Appendix D: Derivation of physical properties of
the
Diamond Ring
Column density and mass from [CII]
For the derivation of the [CII] column density (N
CII), we can pre-
sume an optically thinτ≪1 line because the [CII] line profiles
are mostly Gaussian
and do not show self-absorption features, as
frequently observed in dense and warm PDRs (Kabanovic
et al.
2022). We use the equation from Goldsmith et al. (2012):
NCII=ICII

modeling, we employed the [CII]

and additional SOFIA observations of the CO 8→7 line and

Lyman continuum flux
From the GLOSTAR cm-observations of the HIIregion we de-
termine
an ionising flux, assuming a single ionising source, and
that all UV photons are reprocessed within
the region (Sánchez-

For the integrated flux a constant background level

In order to estimate the age of the HIIregion associated
with
the Diamond Ring, we employ results from the simulations of
Tremblin et al. (2014), which
incorporate ram pressure of the
surrounding turbulent medium following Larson’s law (Larson
1981),
in which the HIIregion expands. They built a grid of
1D simulations to estimate the dynamical age of
the HIIregions
and successfully tested their method on well-known regions for
which photometric age
estimations were available. In order to
derive the ionised gas pressure of the HIIregion we first
calcu-

whereθ Dis the angular diameter of the source. We determined
an electron density⟨n e⟩of∼86 cm−3so
that the pressure of
the ionised gas isP=2⟨n e⟩kBTe=1.9·10−10dyne cm−2. We
note that these equations
are valid for a thermal pressure-driven
HIIregion without stellar wind. With these values, we obtain
an
age of the Diamond Ring HIIregion of 2-2.5 Myr, using Fig. 2
of Tremblin et al. (2014). We note
that if the ionising source is
situated within a slab, and the ionised gas is allowed to stream
freely into the lower density environment, the method overesti-
mates the age of the region.
Moreover, the simulations assume a
spherical expansion, whereas in this case, the expansion rapidly
transitions into the snowplough phase. Here, the gas is primarily
driven by the ram pressure of the
stellar wind rather than ther-
mal pressure, as the high-pressure gas inside the HIIregion can
freely escape along directions perpendicular to the slab. Conse-
quently, the expansion velocity
decreases more rapidly than in
a fully confined bubble. As a result, the actual age of the HII
region is likely shorter than 2–2.5 Myr. Another timescale com-
monly discussed in the context of
expanding [CII] bubbles is the
dynamical timescalet dyn=2.3 Myr, which is just the size-velocity
relation and gives an upper-limit, as it assumes a constant expan-
sion speed.
