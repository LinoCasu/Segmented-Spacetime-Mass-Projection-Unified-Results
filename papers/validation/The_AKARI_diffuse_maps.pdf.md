Abstract
We descibe the calibration of maps of diﬀuse Galac-
tic Plane emission, and present detailed observations of
several complexes. We put especial atention on Cygnus X
region showing its temperature and density maps.
1. Introduction
Maps of the diﬀuse Galactic Plane emission with AKARI
provide a considerable increase in sharpness and fidelity
over previously available data from the IRAS all sky sur-vey, and cover much larger areas than ISO achieved. The
AKARI maps show many interesting structures and re-
gions related to star formation activity in the Galaxy, trac-ing the physical processes that trigger high and low mass
star formation, and their distribution along the Galactic
Plane.
Cygnus X is one of the most complex regions of the
Galactic plane fit in the Gould Belt. Its complexity is dueto the fact that Cygnus is in the line of sight towards
the local spiral arm and so that an enormous quantity
of molecular complexes and star forming regions can beobserved in it’s direction. IRAS satellite confirmed that
there is an important star formation activity in the region
showing thousands of infrared sources some of them withcold spectra at far infrared wavelengths indicating that
they are probably protostellar objects recently formed sur-
rounded by molecular clouds (Dobashi et al., 1994). IRASalso revealed a big population of young stellar objects
(YSO) some of which show a complex distribution of high
velocity material and outflows which are characteristic
of the earliest phase of stellar evolution (Odenwald &
Schwartz, 1993). The presence of protostellar objects, YSOs,
and outflows suggests that star formation processes are
taking place in the molecular clouds of Cygnus.
2. The AKARI diffuse maps calibration
The AKARI diﬀuse maps show a systematic positional
shift compared with data produced by other instrumentsand also when FIS data observed at two diﬀerent pe-
riod are compared. In addition, both the flux calibration
and colour corrections must be done separately for diﬀuse
emission maps.
2.1. Positional error
The data used in this section are from AKARI All-Sky
Survey observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud, during
a two week period in October and November 2006 and two
weeks between April and May 2007. Position errors weredetermined by comparing the locations of several point
sources on the LMC maps from both AKARI and from
Spitzer data. A systematic position oﬀset was found inthe scan direction between AKARI and Spitzer, as well as
between the maps performed at diﬀerent dates. Once the
images were shift corrected, the accuracy of the positionwas verified on the diﬀuse maps by correlating both the
AKARI WS and Spitzer 70 μm maps. The images were
shifted one respect the other pixel by pixel and for each
new position a new correlation factor was determined. So
the correlation array was obtained and the shift value was
the diﬀerence on the position beween the central position
of the array and the position corresponding to the larger
value of the correlation factor. Figure 1 shows the corre-lation between Spitzer and AKARI before and after the
shift correction.
2.2. Flux calibration
We used data from the ISO LWS instrument in the parallel
mode to calculate the colour correction and the conversionfactors.
2.2.1. Colour correction factors
The ISO LWS observed ∼1% of the sky with ten detec-
tors acting as a narrow-band photometer operating at 10
fixed wavelengths between 46 and 180 μm. For each pixel
there is a SED that can be fitted by a modified black
body curve to estimate the temperature, spectral index

and optical depth. Accordingly, the temperature, emissiv-
ity and optical depth maps were carried out for varioussmall regions along the galactic plane and colour correc-
tion factors ( K) were calculated for a black body spectral
energy distribution using the temperature and emissivitymaps:

tion that was calculated for a flat spectrum ( νFν=cte)

2.2.2. Conversion factors
We reproduced ISO intensity maps at 65, 90, 140 and 160
μm using temperature, spectral index and the reference
optical depth maps, so the conversion factors were deter-
mined as the ratio of ISO Flux (MJy/sr) between AKARITable 1. Colour Correction Factors (K) and Conversion Fac-

sition and colour corrected and turned into MJy/sr using
the conversion factors from table 1, show a very good cor-relation with ISO parallel mode data. Figure 2 show this
correlation at 65 and 90 μm.

3. An Overview of the AKARI diffuse maps
The AKARI FIS diﬀuse maps present an opportunity to
study distribution and properties of dust, structure anddistribution of the star forming regions along the Galactic
plane, and the mechanisms that trigger massive-star for-
mation, with better spatial resolution than IRAS achieved.In this section several regions from the AKARI diﬀuse
Galactic plane at 90 μm are compared with IRAS 100
μm.

forming region, observed by IRAS at 100 μm and AKARISPICA joint European/Japanese Workshop

FIS at 90 μm. DR15 consists of a number of individual
HII regions excited by a cluster of young OB stars (Isra¨ el,
1977; Colley, 1980). G79.29+0.46 is a ring like radio sourcethat was observed for the first time with the DRAO tele-
scope. It has a faint blue star at its centre that is the
responsible for the shell (Waters et al., 1996). Figure 4 re-veals NGC2467 HII region, also known as Sharpless 311, at
a distance ∼4-5 pc (Pismis & Moreno, 1976), and Haﬀner
19 HII region.
The IRAS images were taken from the IRS Galaxy
Atlas with a high resolution ( ∼1
/prime). Both, Haﬀner 19 on
Puppis and the radio source G79.29+0.46 in Cygnus, aredetected on the AKARI 90 μm images while they are im-
perceptible in the IRAS maps at 100 μm, probably be-
cause at this wavelength the galactic background is very
strong, although IRAS did resolve these features at 24 and
60μm (Waters et al., 1996).
Figure 5 coveres NGC1333 reflexion nebula that is the
most active region of star formation in the Perseus molec-
ular cloud. IRAS image at 100 μm with a resolution of
∼4
/primewas taken from the Skyview, while the AKARI im-age at 90 μm with a resolution of ∼40/prime/primeis able to resolve
the two clumps observed on the IRAS map in a structure
of several disconnected clumps.
4. Cygnus X star forming region
Figure 6 is a composite image of Cygnus X at three AKARI
FIS bands: 65 μm, 90 μm and 140 μm. The image is cen-
tred at: l= 79.76◦and b=0.78◦with an area of 61.3
degrees. The map looks a bit striped in the scan direc-
tion. This stripes are due to changes in the responsivityof the detectors from one scan to the other.

bands: 65 μm( b l u e ) ,9 0 μm (green) and 140 μm( r e d ) .
4.1. The temperature and density maps
We calculated the temperature and the density maps from
this region by fitting the four AKARI FIS bands: 65 μm,
90μm, 140 μm and 160 μm with a modified black body

regions across Cygnus X are distributed in a range ofT∼20-35 K. The temperature values obtained are lower
than those values determined by Odenwald & Schwartz
(1993) who obtained values of T ∼38-42 K. The hottest
areas in the temperature map are distributed tracing the
OB asociations: OB9, OB8 and OB2, as well as the area
around the HII regions DR22 and DR23, and DR16. Avery warm area can be observed at the HII region DR15,
with temperatures T ∼40 K. There are some very cold ob-
jects with temperatures T <10 K. Some of this regions are
close to DR21 and W75, spread through a circle centered

one of the most conspicuous feature in the density map,
showing very high density values ( NH2>1022cm−2).
This feature also appeared in the density map obtained
by Odenwald & Schwartz (1993) and is very good traced
by AKARI FIS at 160 μm.
The density map shows very typical values for molecu-
lar clouds of NH∼1021cm−2. The West side of the map
shows larger densities, ∼5×1021cm−2, than the East of
the map.

tom) from Cygnus X region.
4.2. The luminosity function
A matched filter point source extraction routine for clumpy
backgrounds was used in order to remove the background
of the image. SExtractor was used in order to extract all
the sources from Cygnus X using a 3 σthreshold, once the
backgroun was removed. The number of sources extracted
bySExtractor with an intensity larger than the WS de-
tection limit (0.21 Jy, [5 σ/scan]) was 5573. From all these
sources, only 800 have fluxes larger than the detection
limit for each of the four AKARI bands:

Figure8. Luminosity function.
The luminosity function shows a maximum number of
sources with luminosities in the range 100-200 L⊙. Sources
with luminosities <60L⊙are missing due to the high de-
tection limit of the Wide-L band.
5. Summary
AKARI, with a 0.7 m aperture, completed the All-sky sur-
vey covering about 94% of the entire sky with better spa-
tial resolution and wider wavelength coverage than IRAS
in the wavelength range from 65 to 180 μm.
SPICA is a cooled infrared observatory whose 3.5 m
aperture will provide sensitive data with wider far infrared
spectral coverage than AKARI. Its sensitivity will be fourorders of magnitude better than AKARI FIS, allowing
studies of: galaxies and stars formation; evolution of plan-
etary systems; KBOs, minor planets, comets and otherobjects in our solar systems, as well as the detection of
extrasolar planets due to its high sensitivity.
