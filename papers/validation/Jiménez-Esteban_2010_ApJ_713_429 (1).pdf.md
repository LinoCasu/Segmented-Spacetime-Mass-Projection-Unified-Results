ABSTRACT
Aiming to perform a study of the warm dust and gas in the luminous blue variable star G79.29+0.46 and
its associated nebula, we present infrared Spitzer imaging and spectroscopy, and new CO J=2→1 and
4→3 maps obtained with the IRAM 30 m radio telescope and the Submillimeter Telescope, respectively.
We have analyzed the nebula detecting multiple shells of dust and gas connected to the star. Using Infrared
Spectrograph- Spitzer spectra, we have compared the properties of the central object, the nebula, and their
surroundings. These spectra show a rich variety of solid-state features (amorphous silicates, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and CO 2ices) and narrow emission lines, superimposed on a thermal continuum. We have also
analyzed the physical conditions of the nebula, which point to the existence of a photo-dissociation region.
Key words: circumstellar matter - dust, extinction - ISM: individual objects (G79.29+0.46) - ISM: lines and
bands - stars: evolution - stars: mass-loss
1. INTRODUCTION
Luminous blue variable (LBV) stars are massive objects
which, as they evolve from the main sequence, undergo a short
period of extremely high mass loss (up to 10−3M⊙yr−1), some-
times accompanied by so-called giant eruptions, such as the
well-known nineteenth-century outburst of ηCar (Smith &
Owocki 2006 ). This mass loss strongly influences the further
stellar evolution and leads to the formation of extended circum-
stellar nebula (see Humphreys & Davidson 1994 for a review).
Clark et al. ( 2005 ) reported a total of 12 galactic LBV stars and
23 LBV candidates. From the whole sample, however, only 20
have nebular circumstellar emission. Such nebulae have both
gaseous and dusty components, and two kinds of geometry,
spherical and bipolar, have been recognized.
Since LBV nebulae are strong emitters in the mid- and far-
infrared, the physical and chemical conditions of the material
surrounding LBV stars can be traced studying their spectral
characteristics in this wavelength range. Thus, a few of thesenebulae were spectroscopically studied with the Infrared Space
Observatory (ISO) satellite, revealing the presence of solid
state features characteristic of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) and silicate dust in both forms, amorphous and crys-
talline (e.g., Lamers et al. 1996a ; V oors et al. 1999 ,2000b ). To-
gether with these, numerous forbidden lines on top of a smoothcontinuum were detected (e.g., Lamers et al. 1996b ).
With the advent of Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al.
2004 ), unprecedented high sensitivity and resolution imaging
and spectroscopy have been possible in the infrared, making
feasible the study of LBV nebulae with much great detail. Thus,
recently new works have been published (Morris et al. 2008 ;
Smith 2007 ; Umana et al. 2009 ; Gvaramadze et al. 2009 ) based
on these new data, which have represented an important step
forward in the knowledge of this brief evolutionary phase ofhigh-mass stars.
The molecular gas in LBV nebulae is also a subject of interest.
It may trace radiatively affected and /or shocked regions, which
6Spanish Virtual Observatorymay tell us about the evolution of the progenitor star. In addition,
the chemical evolution and the formation of circumstellar
molecular gas may also be determined by molecular studies.Gaseous CO was firstly detected around the AG Car nebula
(Nota et al. 2002 ) and after then in some other objects (Rizzo
et al. 2008a ). Highly excited ammonia was also detected in the
Homunculus Nebula (Smith et al. 2006 ).
Concerning the molecular counterpart, the most stud-
ied source is G79.29+0.46 (Rizzo et al. 2008b , hereafter
Paper I). In this object, the detection of the CO J=3→2
line surrounding the nebula unveiled the presence of moder-
ately dense (10
4-105cm−3) CO gas, probably affected by a
C-shock at a velocity of ∼15 km s−1. This CO-ring-like struc-
ture has a diameter of ∼3./prime2, and it is strikingly homogeneous in
shape.
The origin of the nebula of G79.29+0.46 is not clear. From
Very Large Array (VLA) observations of radio continuumand H i, Higgs et al. ( 1994 ) showed the thermal nature of
the continuum emission and suggested that the nebula is an
ionized shell of ∼15M
⊙of swept-up interstellar material.
However, after examining the IRAS high-resolution images of
G79.29+0.46, Waters et al. ( 1996 ) concluded that it is a detached
shell due to an epoch of high mass loss ( ∼5×10−4M⊙yr−1)
during the red supergiant or LBV phase, followed by a less
intense mass-loss period.
Concerning the central object, it has been spectroscopically
studied in the optical and in the near-infrared wavelength range
(Waters et al. 1996 ; V oors et al. 2000b ). Its LBV classification
is supported by the high luminosity ( >105L⊙), the moderate
stellar wind (94-110 km s−1), and the current high mass-loss rate
(10−6M⊙yr−1; Waters et al. 1996 ). Unfortunately, its effective
temperature ( Teff) is not well known because it is highly model
dependent. The detection of a He iemission line near Br α
(Waters et al. 1996 ) suggests a Teffwell above 10,000 K. On the
other hand, the LBV nature of the central star may limit the Teff
to a maximum of 30,000 K.
In Paper I, a careful discussion about the distance to
G79.29+0.46 was done. We will assume a distance of 1.7 kpcthroughout all the paper.

decl.) J2000=(20h31m42.s3,+40◦21/prime58/prime/prime). A linear brightness scale has been artificially selected for each individual image to better show weak and diffuse features,
instead of point-like objects. Note an outer thin second shell clearly visible only at 24 μm.
The fingerprint of stellar evolution onto the circumstellar /
interstellar medium (ISM) can provide a valuable input to learn
about the processes, which govern the star itself and also affect
the evolution of the surrounding gas and dust. The aim of thispaper is to trace the distribution of warm dust, PAHs, and
gaseous CO in relation with G79.29+0.46 and its associated
nebula. To do this, we present infrared Spitzer imaging and
spectroscopy, and new submillimeter CO J=2→1 and 4 →3
maps obtained with the IRAM 30 m radio telescope and theSubmillimeter Telescope (SMT), respectively. In comparison to
Paper I, this new data set improves the angular resolution and
the analysis of the physical conditions.
2.SPITZER DATA
The Spitzer data used in this paper have been obtained from
the public Spitzer archive.

Two cameras are on board Spitzer : the Infrared Array Camera
(IRAC; Fazio et al. 2004 ) and the Multiband Imaging Photome-
ter (MIPS; Rieke et al. 2004 ), which provide imaging capability
from 3 to 200 μm.
Near-infrared images were obtained on 2007 July 5 using
the four IRAC bands at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 μm, as part of
the program 30188 (AOR 17330688). Mid-infrared images at24 and 70 μm were also obtained using MIPS as part of the
program 40184 (AOR 22510592) on 2007 December 2. We have
worked with the standard post-basic calibrated data (BCD) datasets, for both IRAC and MIPS images, as retrieved with Leopard
from the Spitzer archive. They were processed with the version
S16.1.0 and S16.1.1, respectively. Aladin
8was used to cut the
images to show a field of view of 9/prime×9/primecentered on the LBV
star. These images are shown in Figure 1. The brightness scale

2.2. IRS Spectra
The Spitzer satellite has a third instrument on board, the
Infrared Spectrograph (IRS; Houck et al. 2004 ). It provides
crucial spectroscopic information in the wavelength range from
5t o4 0 μm.
Three targets in the field of G79.29+0.46 have been spec-
troscopically observed in four observational programs: a target
including the exciting star and its surroundings (hereafter called“the central object”), a target centered at a position where the
ring nebula is most prominent (hereafter called “the shell”),
and a nearby infrared dark cloud (hereafter called “the IRDC”).These observations are tabulated in Table 1, and the positions
of the IRS slits are shown in Figure 2. It should be noted that
all three, the central object, the shell, and the IRDC, includeemission from nearby regions than the targets themselves.
The spectra were obtained by using all possible modules:
short-low (SL), short-high (SH), long-low (LL), and long-high(LH). There are low-resolution spectra (SL and LL) for the
three studied targets, which cover the spectral range from 5.2
to 38.0 μm. However, high-resolution spectra (SH and LH),
covering the spectral range from 9.2 to 37.2 μm, are only
available for the central object. We have worked with the
standard post-BCD data sets. We have cleaned the resultingone-dimensional spectra for residual bad pixels flagged by the
pipeline and visually inspected to identify spurious jumps and
glitches. No spurious jumps were detected and the glitches foundwere interpolated. Finally, we have merged the different orders
of each module into one final spectrum per module using an
IDL code developed to this end. We have not corrected for basicaperture and slit loss. Spectra are shown in Figures 3-5.
In the case of the central object, the target has been observed
on three different occasions (see Table 1). The first time
(AOR 7557888), the IRS slits were not correctly positioned
over the central object. The second time (AOR 9761024), there
should have been a flux calibration problem, since the two ordersdo not match. The third time (AOR 17333248), the data do not
show any problem. Thus, we have used these last spectra for
the analysis, corresponding with the modules SL, SH, and LH.
However, on this last occasion LL spectrum was not taken, so
we have used for the analysis the LL spectrum correspondingto the AOR 9761024. The SL spectrum of the AOR 9761024
and those of the AOR 7557888 have been used to confirm thedetection of the solid spectral features and the emission lines
(see Section 4.3).
3. CO OBSERV ATIONS
3.1. CO J =2→1 Line Emission
We used the IRAM 30 m radio telescope at Pico Veleta
(Spain) in 2008 February, to map the CO J=2→1 line emission
i nar e g i o no f ∼7
/prime×7/primearound G79.29+0.46. The front end was
the nine-beam HERA receiver (Schuster et al. 2004 ). In order to
optimize both observing time and sampling, we used the on-the-
flymode. A total of four individual maps, in orthogonal sampling
directions, were obtained and later combined in a single datacube using the GILDAS package. The VESPA autocorrelator
was used as back end, in frequency switching mode. The
final bandwidth was 44 MHz (equivalent to ∼57 km s
−1at
the rest frequency), and the spectral resolution was 80 kHz
(∼0.1 km s−1). Due to the frequency switching, mesospheric
CO emission had to be removed from all the spectra. Afterfolding, low-order polynomials were fitted to remove baselines
using CLASS software package (also included in GILDAS).
Typical rms was 0.2 K, in T
∗
Ascale.
Calibration was performed during the observations using two
absorbers at different temperatures and later checked up on
standard sources (Mauersberger et al. 1989 ). The uncertainty in
calibration is below 15%. The angular resolution of the radio
telescope at 230 GHz half-power beam width (HPBW) is 11/prime/prime.
However, we have further degraded the final map down to 18/prime/prime,
in order to reduce the map noise and to get the same HPBW
corresponding to the CO J=4→3 map.
Some other emission lines were observed during the same
observing session. The results from these lines will be released
in a future paper (J. R. Rizzo et al. 2010, in preparation), togetherwith a more complete analysis of the CO J=2→1 results.
3.2. CO J =4→3 Line Emission
The observations of the CO J=4→3 line were made in
2006 June with the SMT, located on Mount Graham, Arizona.
The telescope is a 10.4 m diameter primary with a nutatingsecondary. Design, optics, and structural aspects of the telescope
were extensively described by Baars et al. ( 1999 ). The single-
channel receiver SORAL-490 was used under excellent weatherconditions ( τ
461 GHz ∼0.4-0.5). As the back end, we used one
of the acousto-optical spectrometers (AOSCs), which provides
an usable bandwidth of about 250 MHz (corresponding to

162 km s−1of coverage) and a spectral resolution of 367 kHz
(0.24 km s−1).
The receiver was calibrated with ambient temperature and
a liquid nitrogen-cooled absorbing load. Calibration of the
final data has uncertainties below 20%. System temperaturewas measured with the standard sky /ambient temperature load
method (Kutner & Ulich 1981 ). Calibrations were performed
every 15-20 minutes to track variations in atmospheric opacity.Typical system temperature during the observations was in the
range of 1000-1200 K, depending on the elevation and the
atmospheric opacity.
The pointing was checked within 2 hr on a planet or
other bright continuum source. Corrections to the pointing
model were not more than 4
/prime/primein either azimuth or elevation.
Planet observations were also used to compute the main-beam
efficiency at the observed frequency.
Only a small area toward the southwest of G79.29+0.46
was observed, where the most interesting CO features appear
(Paper I). Position switching was employed, using the same ref-
erence position for all observed points. Due to time restriction,the CO J=4→3 map was sampled only by one beam (18
/prime/prime)i n
both equatorial coordinates, and hence it is not fully sampled.
The reduction processes were similar to those of IRAM’s data,already described in Section 3.1.4. RESULTS
4.1. Infrared Images
The distance assumed for G79.29+0.46 is consistent with
its probable identification as a member of Cyg OB2. Located
at the southern part and close to the border of Cyg OB2,
G79.29+0.46 is behind the Great Cygnus Rift, just to the
northwest of the intense radio source DR 15, which causes high
visual extinction from 4 to at least 10 mag. Thus, the infraredemission of G79.29+0.46 is expected to be heavily contaminated
by foreground /background emission, as it is clearly noticeable
in all Spitzer images. In addition, a large-scale infrared emission
is also present toward the east of the images. This large-scale
emission increases its relative intensity with respect to the
background with the wavelength, and is similar to the large-scale CO gas emission noted in Paper I at millimeter and
submillimeter wavelengths. It was related to the cloud around
DR 15 (Oka et al. 2001 ). Due to this strong contamination, we
refrain from computing the dust mass, as it is a hard task and
the results might not be reliable enough.
The central object is detected in all Spitzer bands but MIPS
70μm. We used MOPEX supported software to perform point-
spread function (PSF) photometry in the MIPS 24 μm image,
obtaining a flux density of 0.89 Jy for the central object. Due to

saturation problems, it was not possible to obtain the fluxes of
the central object at shorter wavelengths.
The ring nebula previously detected by the IRAS and
Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX ) satellites (Waters et al.
1996 ;E g a ne ta l . 2002 ) is discernible from 3.6 to 70 μm. The
nebular emission dominates the image at 24 μm, being just
above the background level at shorter and longer wavelengths.
The nebula presents a pretty spherical shape with a diameter of
∼3./prime7(∼1.8 pc). The shell looks like incomplete to the south,
probably due to a foreground IRDC, which is known to possess
a very large visual extinction (Redman et al. 2003 ). However,
it is not clear whether this IRDC is part of the large complexincluding DR 15 or it is an unrelated foreground cloud (Egan
et al. 1998 ).
Thanks to the high angular resolution and sensitivity of these
Spitzer images, we have discovered an outstanding new, outer
shell with almost spherical shape as well. This outer shell isFigure 4. IRS SL module spectra of the shell and the IRDC. The most prominent
spectral lines and solid bands are labeled in the figure.

only visible in the 24 μm image (Figure 1) and has a diameter
of∼6./prime8, (∼3.4 pc). During the process of writing this paper,
Gvaramadze et al. ( 2009 ) reported a diffuse halo associated with
G79.29+0.46, which corresponds to the inside of this newlydiscovered shell.
4.2. CO Maps
As we show below, the CO data shown here improve the
results gathered in Paper I, due to a higher angular resolution
and lower rms noise compared to those in Paper I, providinga higher signal-to-noise ratio (S /N). In addition, mapping the
COJ=4→3 line emission allows us to test a wider range of
excitation conditions, due to the higher energy levels involvedand the critical density needed to excite this line. According
to the aim of this work, here we provide the most relevant
morphological features, postponing a more detailed dynamicalstudy to a future paper (J. R. Rizzo et al. 2010, in preparation).
The whole velocity range of emission in the J=2→1
line goes from −25 to 15 km s

Figure 6. Left: CO J=2→1 map in the surroundings of G79.29+0.46, as obtained with the IRAM 30 m radio telescope. The map is centered on the LBV star, and
the velocity range of integration is from −3.2 to −2.6 km s−1. The pointed square indicates the observed field, and gray scale corresponds to the 24 μm emission.
Contours are 40%-90% of the peak value (11.8 K in T∗
Ascale), in steps of 10%. Right: CO J=4→3 map in the same velocity range, corresponding exactly to the

scale), in steps of 10%. In both maps, the angular resolutions are shown as white circles in the lower right. It is striking the high correlation of the CO emission in this
velocity range with the infrared inner shell. The CO shell is especially thin in the J=4→3 map, unresolved by the beam.

corresponds to the Local Arm, where the confusion effects
are presumably the highest. The most outstanding features in
relation to G79.29+0.46 appear in velocity ranges similar tothose shown in Paper I (see Figure 4of that paper). Figures 6
and7show the CO J=2→1 and 4 →3 distributions in the
velocity ranges from −3.2 to−2.6 and from +3.4 to +4.0 km s
−1,
respectively. The CO J=2→1 line contours are superposed
to an image at 24 μm in gray scale.
For the J=2→1 data, a Gaussian convolution has been
applied, down to a resolution of 18/prime/prime. This convolution reduces
the noise map and equals the angular resolution of the J=4→3
line. In both figures, the inset in the J=2→1 maps correspondsexactly to the mapped area in the J=4→3 line, shown on the
right.
In Figure 6, an arc-like feature dominates the map, in good
coincidence with the 24 μm inner shell, especially in the western
half. The J=4→3 line emission depicts part of a remarkable
thin shell, unresolved even at 18/prime/primeof resolution.
The shocked clump, unresolved in Paper I, is clearly seen in
Figure 7. In this velocity range, all the emission is outside the
24μm inner shell. The southwestern feature, also observed in
theJ=4→3 line emission, looks like part of a second CO
shell. Note that this feature is located outside the shell shown in
Figure 6.

No. 1, 2010 MULTIPLE SHELLS AROUND G79.29+0.46 435
The emission at velocities intermediate to those of Figures 6
and7does not show any shell-like pattern, and consequently
we think that the two shells are different features and not the
consequence of a mere velocity gradient. Summarizing, at the
southwestern part of the field, we see two CO concentric slabs,
which fill the space between the two shells detected at 24 μm.
4.3. Infrared Spectra
The infrared spectral data show a rich variety of solid-state
features and narrow emission lines, superimposed on a thermal
continuum.
Using the low-resolution IRS spectra, it is possible to study
the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the three observed tar-
gets (Figure 3). The SED of the central object (upper panel)
shows that the flux decreases from 5 to about 19 μm and
increases again to longer wavelengths. This behavior may be
roughly explained by two emitters at two different temperatures,
i.e., hotter (shorter wavelengths) and colder material (longerwavelengths). The middle and lower panels of Figure 3corre-
spond to the spectra of the shell and the IRDC, respectively.
These two last SEDs are dominated by the colder component.
The three SEDs present an astonishing similarity for
λ>25μm. This suggests that this emission is due to interstellar
material which is present in all regions and extends beyond theobserved area.
Figure 2shows the position of the IRS spectra slits for the
three regions observed. It is clear that the SL and LL spectraof the central object are affected by the shell emission. The
effect is maximum at longer wavelengths, since the emission of
the shell at shorter wavelengths is negligible when comparedwith the emission of the central object (see Figure 3). Thus, in
order to remove the contribution of the shell emission to the
central object SED, we have scaled the LL spectrum of theshell to fit that of the central object at the longest wavelengths
(>32μm) and later subtracted from the last one. The result is
shown in Figure 3(upper panel) with a solid line. The subtracted
central object SED shows the decreasing tail of the central object
emission. In addition, several spectral lines ([Ne iii] at 15.5 μm,
[Siii] at 18.71 and 33.4 μm, H
2at 28.2 μm , and [S iii]a t
34.8μm) have disappeared of the central object spectrum.
4.3.1. Solid-state Features
The SEDs of the central object and the IRDC reveal an
absorption feature at around 9.7 μm, more prominent in the case
of the central object, particularly clear after subtracting the shell
contribution (Figures 3and4). It corresponds to the well-known
9.7μm amorphous silicates feature due to the Si-O stretching
in the dust grains. The presence of amorphous silicates was alsoreported in the dusty nebula surrounding the LBV stars HR Car
(Lamers et al. 1996a ; Umana et al. 2009 ) and Wra 751 (V oors
et al. 2000a ). Note, however, that these stars present the feature
in emission instead of absorption as in the case of G79.29+0.46,
which is puzzling and has to be explained. In addition, the SED
of the shell seems to present a shallow depression at around9.7μm that could be interpreted as a weak absorption due to
amorphous silicate dust.
The broad, strong emission features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and
12.7μm present in the SL spectrum of the shell (See Figure 4,
upper panel) are due to vibrational modes of free-flying PAHs
(Leger & Puget 1984 ; Allamandola et al. 1985 ). The same
features seem to appear in the spectrum of the IRDC, but the flux
is too low for reliable detections. These PAHs features suggest
the presence of very small C rich dust grains or molecules inthe shell of G79.29+0.46. PAHs have also been detected in the
shell of the galactic LBV stars AG Car (V oors et al. 2000a ) and
HR 168625 (Skinner 1997 ), and in the LBV star R71 of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (V oors et al. 1999 ).
Another interesting solid-state feature, present only in the
spectrum of the IRDC, is the CO
2bending mode at about 15 μm
(see Figure 3, lower panel). Since the formation and evolution
of interstellar ices is strongly dependent on local conditions, the
presence of CO 2ice in the spectrum of the IRDC indicates that
the physical conditions are rather different from those in the
central object and in the shell. CO 2ice has never been detected
in the surroundings of a massive evolved star, but is usual inother astronomical objects, such as high- and intermediate-mass
protostars (Ehrenfreund et al. 1998 ; Peeters et al. 2002 ; Lefloch
et al. 2008 ). The CO
2absorption feature found could be coming
either from the quiescent regions of the IRDC (south of the LBV
nebula) or from the compact source lying within the southern
slit (see Figure 2). Note that this compact source was reported
as a young stellar object by Redman et al. ( 2003 ).
4.3.2. Emission Lines
The IRS high-resolution spectra of the central object are full
of fine structure lines that may provide important constraints tothe physical conditions in the region. The most prominent ones
are also detected in the low-resolution spectra and are labeled
in the figures. For each line, a first-order baseline has beendefined and the line has been fitted to a Gaussian. To do this,
we have used an iterative software developed by Bayo ( 2009 ).
The identification and the measured fluxes are summarized inTable 2, including possible multiple identifications. Flux errors
are between brackets. All line fluxes for the central object have
been measured in the high-resolution IRS spectra but H iat
7.46μm. In the case of the shell and the IRDC, line fluxes have
been measured in the respective low-resolution IRS spectra.
There is a mismatch between the SH and LH spectra of thecentral object which is usually attributed to a difference in the
two module apertures, and which has been taken into account
when comparing fluxes of SH with those of LH spectra.
The collection of spectral lines found is similar to that shown
by the LBV star HR Car (Umana et al. 2009 ) and the LBV
candidate HDE 316285 (Morris et al. 2008 ). The nebular spectra
of HDE 316285 show, for the first time in this kind of objects,
pure rotational lines of H
2arising from optically thin quadrupole
transitions, from S(0) to S(6). We have also clearly detectedthe two lower rotational lines, S(0) and S(1), in the spectra
of the central object and the shell, and S(0) in the spectrum
of the IRDC. Although these lines may arise from a foregroundcomponent, or even DR 15, the presence of H
2in the shell or
in the circumstellar material is a possibility which has to be
explored in follow-up observations.
5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Multiple Shells in G79.29+0.46
The data shown in this paper clearly show multiple dust and
gas shells connected to the central star of G79.29+0.46. The
MIPS 24 μm image shows two well-defined dust shells. Figure
6shows how the CO shell coexists next to the inner dusty shell,
while Figure 7shows another slab located between the two dust
shells.
To explore the possibility of the existence of a more inner
shell closer to the LBV star, we have roughly fitted the SED
of the central object after subtracting the contribution of the

shell with a combination of two blackbodies. Two ranges of
temperatures were tried, from 10,000 to 30,000 K for the stellar
contribution and from 200 to 1500 K for a possible inner
envelope. Fitting does not vary significantly in the consideredranges of temperature corresponding to the hotter blackbody.
However, the best fit regardless the stellar temperature was
always obtained with a second blackbody of ∼900 K. This result
is compatible with the existence of an inner shell unresolved by
theSpitzer images. Figure 3shows the best fit for a stellar
temperature of 20,000 K. This conclusion is supported by thedetection of H
2lines in the spectra of the central object. It
is necessary a thick dust envelope to be able to explain the
existence of H 2so close to the LBV star. This thick dust envelope
would shield the molecule gas from the strong UV field of the
star.
From the morphology, it seems that the two dusty shells re-
solved by the Spitzer images are interacting with the surrounding
medium (see Figure 1), presumably with material belonging to
the DR 15 cloud. Figure 7also shows clear evidence of theerosion of the ISM by the stellar wind, specially at the south-
western region. At this region, we already reported in Paper I
the presence of a shock front.
In Paper I, we estimated an age of the nebula between
103and 104yr. This is in well agreement with the high sphericity
shown by the two dust shells. Thus, the mass-loss events which
have produced the multiple shells have occurred relativelyrecently, i.e., in the current evolutionary stage.
In order to obtain a dust temperature, we have also fitted
the continuum emission of the shell and the IRDC, with acombination of two blackbodies at different temperatures. In
the case of the shell, a blackbody of 65 K and another of 132 K
were necessary. For the IRDC, one of 66 K and another of 187 Kwere used. The resulting fits are shown in Figure 3. In both cases,
two dust components at different temperatures were found, one
common component at ∼65 K and another hotter. Probably,
the cold component is due to foreground interstellar material
belonging to the H iiregion DR 15, as typical dust temperatures
of H iiregions are around 60-70 K (Peeters et al. 2002 ). This is

No. 1, 2010 MULTIPLE SHELLS AROUND G79.29+0.46 437
the main dust component and would explain why both spectra
have the same overall shape at longer wavelengths. Regarding
the hot component of the shell, its temperature is similar (same
order) to the temperatures estimated for the dust in other LBV
nebulae (300 K; V oors et al. 1999 ) and in supernova remnants
(SNRs) associated with shocks ( ∼110 K; Tappe et al. 2006 ;
Ghavamian et al. 2009 ). Note that the temperature of the hot
component of the shell is slightly lower than the temperature of
the hot component of the IRDC. Although these temperaturesshould be seen with caution due to the presence of the CO
2ice
absorption feature, the slightly higher temperature in the IRDC
could be due to the presence of a young stellar object in the slit(see Figure 2).
The most external dust shell is only visible in the 24 μm
image. It is expected that the dust in this shell would have alower temperature than the dust in the inner shells. Thus, the
dust temperature of the most external shell should not be well
above 120 K. Assuming that the mid-infrared images are tracingthe thermal continuum emission of the dust, this would explain
why it is not detected at shorter wavelengths. The fact that this
shell is neither detected at 70 μm could be due to a combination
of strong foreground /background emission at this wavelength,
lower sensitivity of MIPS in this band, and a non-appropriate
data reduction of the image.
The 9.7 μm amorphous silicates feature in absorption is
clearly present in the SL spectra of the central object and
the IRDC, and is tentatively detected in the shell. Amorphoussilicates in LBV stars are supposed to be formed at temperatures
well below the silicates melting point in the outer layers of the
star which cool very rapidly while the material is being sweptup by a fast wind. The silicates would indicate that the stellar
ejecta was oxygen rich (C/O <1), as expected for LBV stars
which are supposed to have ejecta enriched by the CNO cycle
(Nota et al. 1997 ). However, G79.29+0.46 shows the 9.7 μm
amorphous silicates feature in absorption instead of in emissionas the others LBV stars do. A plausible explanation is that
the absorption of amorphous silicates is due to the foreground
ISM, as was recently found in the case of the SNR N157B byMicelotta et al. ( 2009 ). This would explain the presence of this
feature in absorption in the IRDC as well. However, another
possible explanation for the absorption shown in the centralobject spectrum is the presence of amorphous silicate dust in an
inner nebula unresolved by the Spitzer images.
The presence of crystalline silicates in LBV nebulae seems
to be a general trend (Waters et al. 1997 ). This is suggestive of
the grains being formed in high-density and low-temperature
environments (V oors et al. 1999 ). Therefore, and because these
features resemble those observed in red supergiant stars, the
presence of crystalline silicates is explained if the dust is formed
in high-density, slow-expanding environments close to the star,rather than in the swept-up shell. This kind of environment
is typical of the red supergiant phase (Waters et al. 1998 ),
for which wind velocities are between 20 and 30 km s
−1.I n
the case of G79.29+0.46, and similarly to the LBV candidate
HDE 316235 (Morris et al. 2008 ) and the LBV stars ηCarina
and HR Car (Umana et al. 2009 ), its spectrum does not show
any signature of crystalline silicates. The lack of crystalline
silicates could be explained if the nebular material was rapidly
ejected and could not crystallize under conditions of rapidcooling and low monomer densities, as suggested by Morris
et al. ( 2008 ) for HDE 316235. Another possible explanation
would be amorphization of initially crystalline dust, which mayoccur under heavy proton bombardment due to the stellar wind.This last mechanism also explains the lack of crystalline silicates
in the ISM (Carrez et al. 2002 ; Brucato et al. 2004 ).
5.2. Features of Ionized Nebulae
Ratios of fine structure lines can be compared with typical
values found toward H iiregions, photo-dissociation regions
(PDRs), SNR, and the ISM. First, we have considered the ratio
between [Si ii] 34.8 μm and [S iii] 33.5 μm. These two lines are
found in the ISM, and their ratio is indicative of the degree ofexcitation of the gas. According to Simpson et al. ( 2007 ), this
line ratio is ∼2.5 for the diffuse interstellar gas, and just in the
range 0.1-0.6 toward H iiregions. Since the values estimated for
the G79.29+0.46 region are similar to those of H iiregions (0.3
for the IRDC, 0.2 for the shell, and 0.5 for the central object),
this suggests that the three components studied in this work haveimportant amount of ionized gas. While this was expected for the
shell and the central object, where free-free thermal emission
was already detected (Higgs et al. 1994 ), we note that the IRDC
component is most likely picking some emission from the H ii
region DR 15, which is located only 4
/primeto the (south) east of the
LBV star and is covered by the IRS slit.
Similarly, a correlation was found for the ratio between
[Neiii] 15.5 μm and [Ne ii] 12.8 μm, and the ratio between
[Siv] 10.5 μm and [S iii] 18.7 μm( M a r t ´ın-Hern ´andez et al.
2002 ). Such a correlation can be used to measure the degree of
ionization of a region. For the case of the central object, the first
ratio is around 0.7, and the second is around 0.8 (assuming nocontamination from He iiand H iat the [S iv] line). By placing
this value in the diagram ([Ne iii]/[Ne ii] versus [S iv]/[Siii])
of Figure 1 of Mart ´ın-Hern ´andez et al. ( 2002 ), we have found
that the central object lies in an intermediate case between the
Hiiregions with low and high ionization, and in particular it
is close to the value of the Orion Nebula. In addition, we havemeasured the ratio between [Ne iii] 15.5μm and [Ne ii] 12.8μm
for the shell and have found a value around 0.3. It is interesting
to note the finding of Ghavamian et al. ( 2009 ) that slow and
dense shocks produce a ratio around 0.4, which is very similar
to the value found in the shell of G79.29+0.46. This suggests
the presence of slow shocks in the shell, which is completely
consistent with the recent discovery of a slow CO shock in the
southwestern side of the shell of G79.29+0.46 (Paper I).
Finally, from the ratio between [S iii] 33.4 μm and
[Siii] 18.7 μm, one can make a rough estimate of the electron
density. The ratio
9is 1.1, 4.0, and 13.0 for the central object, the
shell, and the IRDC, respectively. The ratio of ∼1 corresponds
to an electron density of ∼500 cm−3(Rubin 1989 ; Rubin et al.
1994 ). These values are consistent with the electron density of
∼1000 cm−3derived by Umana et al. ( 2009 ) for the central ob-
ject of HR Car. For the shell and the IRDC, this ratio is too high
to be able to derive a reliable electron density. This could beindicative of strong extinction for the shell and the IRDC cases,
as found for some positions in the galactic center by Simpson
et al. ( 2007 ).
5.3. PDR Signatures
PAH emission features are present in the SL spectrum of the
shell. This dust material was also detected in the LBV stars
9To compute this ratio, we have corrected the line intensity at 18.7 μmb ya
factor of 3. This factor for aperture losses applies only to the central object, forwhich the flux densities have been calculated in the high-resolution spectra,and the line at 18.7 μm falls in a different module than the line at 33.4 μm. For
the shell and the IRDC, there is no need of correction because both lines fall inthe same module.

438 JIM ´ENEZ-ESTEBAN, RIZZO, & PALAU V ol. 713
AG Car, HR 168625, R71 (V oors et al. 2000b ,1999 ; Skinner
1997 ). PAH emission is supposed to be formed where shocks
act upon cold molecular gas. This is presumably the situation
of G79.29+0.46, where the ionized gas is interacting with themolecular material traced by CO. The presence of shocks is
supported by the morphology (see Figures 1,6, and 7) and by
the detection of the CO J=4→3 line, which has a critical
density of at least several 10
4cm−3.
On the other hand, the spectra of the central object show
[Feii] lines, whereas the same lines are not detected in
the IRDC spectra. These two observational findings would in-
dicate that the Fe abundance close to the star is higher than in
the surrounding ISM. In the ISM, Fe is highly depleted from thegas phase because of condensation onto dust grains, but shocks
would reprocess these dust grains and release Fe atoms into the
gas phase. Therefore, a high abundance of Fe in comparisonwith the ISM would be another evidence of the presence of
shocks close to the LBV star.
The presence of PAHs in the spectrum of the shell, the
detection of low-excitation fine structure lines such as 26.0 μm
[Feii] in the central object spectrum, and the CO gas emission
point out to the existence of a PDR surrounding the ionized partof the nebula. Laurent et al. ( 2000 ) showed a typical spectrum
of a star-forming region, an H iiregion, and a PDR (see their
Figures 1 and 2). In our case, the spectrum of the shell shownin Figure 4is an intermediate case between a PDR and an H ii
region. In addition, the non-detection of [S i]a t2 5 μm and
the detection of [S iii] are characteristic of photon-ionized gas
(Micelotta et al. 2009 ). In fact, [S iii] and [Si ii] are typical PDR
tracers (Tappe et al. 2006 ; Umana et al. 2009 ), along with [Ar iii],
[Neii], [Ne iii], and [S iv] (e.g., Mart ´ın-Hern ´andez et al. 2002 ;
Compi `egne et al. 2008 ; Ghavamian et al. 2009 ), all present in
the central object spectra.
In PDRs, PAHs are non-thermally excited by single ultraviolet
(UV) photons (Sellgren 1984 ), and far-UV photons control both
the thermal and chemical structure of the neutral gas (Tielens &Hollenbach 1985 ). The high values of both the stellar effective
temperature ( T
eff) and luminosity ( L∗) favor the presence of a
PDR where the significant UV field encounters cold moleculargas. However, as the CO shells are at large stellar distances, the
presumably high UV field may be diluted.
Thus, we have made an attempt to estimate the incident UV
field ( G
0) in the 24 μm inner shell. G0is defined as the fraction
of an incident UV field in the ionizing UV range (i.e., between
6 and 13.6 eV). This is usually expressed in units of the Habingfield (1 .2×10
−4erg cm−2s−1sr−1), which is a representative
value of the mean interstellar UV field. G0depends on the stellar
parameters as
G0∝fUV(Teff)·L∗·d−2, (1)
where dis the distance of the affected volume to the star and
fUVis the fraction of the Planck function emitted between 6 and
13.6 eV with respect to the total:
fUV(Teff)=/integraltext13.6e V
6e VBν(Teff)/integraltext∞
0Bν(Teff). (2)
By varying Teffbetween 15,000 and 30,000 K, and L∗
between 1 and 2 ×105L⊙,G0ranges from 0.8 to 3 .0×104,i n
units of Habing field. In the assumed range of Teff,fUVvaries
from 31% to 56% of the total energy emitted by the star. A valuefordof 1 pc was assumed, which corresponds to the distance of
the 24 μm shell to the star, at a distance of 1.7 kpc.These high values of G
0(of the order of 104), together with
moderately high H 2densities (at least several 104cm−3due to
the presence of CO J=4→3), are similar to the conditions
found in extreme PDRs, such as the well-known Mon R2 (Rizzoet al. 2003a ;B e r n ´ee ta l . 2009 ). It is also compatible with the
values found by Umana et al. ( 2009 ) in HR Car. However, PAHs
are expected to be not widespread but located in small regionswhere the restrictive conditions of PDRs apply. A zone close to
the inner 24 μm shell and the CO J=4→3 shells is a good
candidate to search for these fragile large molecules.
5.4. Molecular Hydrogen
The 0-0 S(0) line of H
2has been detected in the three
targets, while the S(1) line has only been identified in the central
object and the shell. Unfortunately, we have not detected more
excited pure rotational lines (S(2) and above), which preventus a thorough excitation study. Despite that, the mere presence
of molecular hydrogen in the close environs of a LBV star is
interesting and deserves further analysis. To the best of our
knowledge, the only reported detection of H
2close to a LBV
was done by Morris et al. ( 2008 ). It is important to note that
Umana et al. ( 2009 ), using similar data sets than ours, did not
found any H 2lines in the dusty nebula HR Car.
Vibrationally excited H 2was also discovered surrounding part
of the Wolf-Rayet nebula NGC 2359 (St-Louis et al. 1998 ), in
correlation with significant amounts of (probably) shocked CO
(Rizzo et al. 2001 ,2003b ).
Our values of the S(1)/S(0) line ratio are not too different to
those found by Tappe et al. ( 2006 ) in a molecular cloud to an
SNR, affected by both UV radiation and shocks. Unfortunately,a deeper analysis from this line ratio is not appropriate due
to the fact that both lines correspond to different species, and
we cannot constrain the ortho-to-para ratio. A better studyincluding more lines and a precise spatial distribution may help
to understand the nature of the emitting H
2lines, as well as a
comparison to several PDR models (see, e.g., Draine & Bertoldi1996 ; Compi `egne et al. 2008 )
6. CONCLUSIONS
In order to shed light on the distribution of warm dust, PAHs
and CO gas in G79.29+0.46, we have analyzed infrared Spitzer
data and observed the CO J=2→1 and 4 →3 lines using the
IRAM 30 m radio telescope and the SMT.
An analysis of the high-sensitivity MIPS 24 μm image has led
us to the discovery of a second outer dusty shell with a spherical
shape, previously overlooked. In addition, the analysis of the
SED of the central object has revealed the possible existenceof a third extremely young dust shell closer to the LBV star,
unresolved in the Spitzer images. Furthermore, the new CO
data shown in this paper have revealed two separated gaseousshells located between the two dusty shells. The dynamic time
of these gaseous components would indicate that the various
shells have been formed during the current evolutionary stage.The presence of multiple shells around a LBV star is of great
interest because its implications for stellar evolution theories.
This would indicate that the mass-loss history has been morecomplex than previously assumed, with periods of enhanced
and dimmed stellar winds instead of a continuous steady one.
Using the IRS low-resolution spectra, we have compared
three regions in the field of G79.29+0.46: the central object,
the shell, and the IRDC. The three studied regions present a
clear similarity at the longest wavelengths ( >25μm), due

No. 1, 2010 MULTIPLE SHELLS AROUND G79.29+0.46 439
to the presence of a large amount of foreground /background
dust at ∼65 K. A rich variety of solid-state features has been
detected. Amorphous silicate features in absorption are present
in the spectra of the central object and the IRDC, probably due
to the foreground ISM and /or to the presence of amorphous
silicate dust in a likely inner nebula very close to the centralLBV star. PAHs features in emission are present in the spectrum
of the shell, and a tentative detection of amorphous silicate in
absorption is reported as well. Furthermore, a CO
2ice feature
in absorption is present in the spectrum of the IRDC.
The IRS high-resolution spectra of the central object are full
of fine structure lines, similar to those detected in other LBVstars. We have also detected pure rotational lines of H
2arising
from optically thin quadrupole transitions in two regions of
G79.29+0.46, the central object and the shell, which is the firstdetection of H
2in the spectrum of a LBV star.
Using different flux line ratios, we have analyzed the physical
conditions of G79.29+0.46 and its surroundings. In the case ofthe shell, indications of slow shocks have been found.
We have estimated an incident UV field in the inner dusty
shell of the order of 10
4in units of Habing field. This high value
ofG0, together with other evidence such as moderately high H 2
densities, the presence of PAHs in the shell, the detection of
low-excitation fine structure lines, and the CO mid-J emission,suggests the existence of a PDR.
This study of the multiple phase material directly associated
with G79.29+0.46 may help to understand its recent past andconsequently the evolutionary mechanisms of this kind of
object. In this sense, G79.29+0.46 becomes a paradigm of LBV
nebula and deserves further studies. In particular, a follow-upstudy of complex molecules should also be carried out, because
they can provide information about the physical parameters in
detail. In addition, similar studies to the one shown in this paper
for other LBVs and evolved massive stars will also help to
understand this short, but crucial, evolutionary phase of high-mass stars.
