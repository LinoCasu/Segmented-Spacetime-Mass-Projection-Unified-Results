ABSTRACT

We
present for the ﬁrst time the detection of mid-J CO line emission in the
outskirts of an evolved
massive star, which indicates the presence of warm and/or
high density molecular gas. Aiming to
learn about the interplay between evolved
massive stars and their surroundings, we have carried out
CO J = 2 → 1,
J = 3 → 2, and 13CO J = 2 → 1 line observations in a 4′ × 4′ ﬁeld around
the ring
nebula G79.29+0.46, which is illuminated by a strong candidate to LBV
star. The whole ﬁeld shows
extended predominant emission in both CO and 13CO
J = 2 → 1 lines, which probably comes from the
large cloud which contains the
star forming region DR 15. When this large-scale emission is removed,
minor
scales features become evident, particularly in the CO J = 3 → 2 line, strikingly
coincident
with the ring nebula. The high critical density of CO J = 3 → 2
(some 104 cm−3) gives additional
support for the association with the massive
star, since high density molecular gas has more chances
to survive in such a harsh
environment. This structure may have been produced by the cumulative
eﬀect
of a strong steady wind in the LBV stage or earlier, which has compressed the

surviving parent molecular cloud. In addition, immersed within this CO feature,
we have also
discovered a higher density clump (at least several ∼ 105 cm−3),
unresolved by the telescope and
probably having a higher kinetic temperature.
Towards the clump, the presence of a jump of 14 − 16
km s−1 in the gas velocity
may indicate the existence of a shockfront. This clump may have been
created by
at least one mass eruption, 103 − 104 yr ago. Thus, this work shows that not all
the
molecular gas is destroyed during massive star evolution, and consequently
we are dealing with a new
laboratory where one can learn about the mass-loss
phenomena associated to the brief LBV stage.

Introduction

Massive stars are the most inﬂuent
sources in the dynamical and chemical evolution
of the galactic interstellar medium (ISM). Although
relatively few in number, massive stars
are the most powerful, the fastest in the evolutionary paths
and the richest from a chemical
viewpoint. Mass-loss phenomena (strong and dense winds, violent mass
ejections) and a
very intense UV ﬁeld provide a signiﬁcant input to their surroundings, which heats,
ionizes,
dissociates, blows out, shocks and enriches the ISM as a whole.

According to current
evolutionary models (see, for example, Maeder & Meynet 1994;
Langer et al. 1994), the main sequence
of massive stars lasts several 106 yr, while the Wolf-
Rayet stage takes some 105 yr. All
intermediate stages last typically from 103 to several
104 yr. Stellar winds, size, eﬀective
temperature and UV ﬂux vary during each phase by
orders of magnitude, while the stellar luminosity
remains almost constant. When these
changes occur, a number of diﬀerent structures in the
circumstellar/interstellar gas should
be produced. Numerical simulations (Garc´ıa-Segura et al.
1996; van Marle et al. 2004) pre-
dict the formation of several shockfronts in the ISM at scales
from tenths to tens of pc.
The possibility of mass eruptions at the intermediate and unstable stages
may also add a
signiﬁcant contribution to the nebular mass (Smith & Owocki 2006).

So far, the study
of the ISM surrounding massive stars constitutes an excellent method
to know about the evolutive
history of the exciting source, because it is expected that
diﬀerent evolutive stages would put
their “ﬁngerprints” in the circumstellar material. Both
neutral and ionized gas have been widely
observed in the last decades, and today we can
recognize many interstellar bubbles associated to the
Main Sequence (Arnal et al. 1999;

– 3 –

Cichowolski et al. 2003) and Wolf-Rayet nebulae (Miller &
Chu 1993; Moore et al. 2000),
among other galactic structures. In recent years, the hot dust
surrounding massive stars was
the subject of several near- and mid-IR observational campaigns, and
we know about the
presence of disks, torus and shells around stars at intermediate evolutive stages
(Becklin et al.
1994; O’Hara et al. 2003).

The search for molecular gas in these environments is
still limited, possibly due to the
a-priori hypothesis by which the parent molecular cloud around an
evolved massive star
may have been destroyed soon after star formation. Even so, the detected low-
excitation
CO (Marston et al. 1999; Nota et al. 2002; Rizzo et al. 2003a) is giving indications that
the
molecular component would represent an important contribution to the total mass of gas.
Unfortunately, the low-J lines observed to date trace densities as low as few 103 cm−3, and
the link
with the stars or the circumstellar material can only be based on the morphology of
the CO
structures, and not on any other physical parameter.

A special and motivating case is NGC 2359. To
date, this is the only Wolf-Rayet nebula
where H2 has been detected at 2 µm (St-Louis et al. 1998).
Later, the global distribution of
CO has been almost simultaneously mapped using the Kitt Peak
(Rizzo et al. 2001a) and
SEST radiotelescopes (Cappa et al. 2001), showing an important amount of
molecular gas
surrounding the optical nebula. Follow-up studies have reported the detection of
complex
molecules (Rizzo et al. 2001b, 2003b) and multiple layers of rather dense gas (≃ 104 cm−3;
Rizzo et al. 2003c). The origin of the molecular gas seems related to stages previous to
Wolf-Rayet
(dynamical lifetimes tdyn ∼ 104 − 105 yr).

This signiﬁcant result encourages the search for
molecular gas in the environs of evolved
massive stars which have not yet become Wolf-Rayet. Of
those, the luminous blue vari-
able (LBV) stars are probably the best candidates, due to the
“instantaneous” eﬀect of their
strong winds and spectacular mass ejections over the star
surroundings (Humphreys & Davidson
1994; Nota & Clampin 1997). The nested shells observed in several
cases around LBV neb-
ulae span masses from 0.1 to 20 M⊙, most of which come from short-lived
eruptions, such as
the well known 19th century outburst of η Car (Smith & Owocki 2006). The multiple
layer
structure discovered in NGC 2359, referred above, may have been formed during a previous
LBV
stage.

A recent census provides a total of 12 conﬁrmed galactic LBV stars and 23 candidates
of such
objects (Clark et al. 2005). G79.29+0.46 appears as a strong LBV candidate in the
sample. Noticed
for the ﬁrst time by Wendker et al. (1991) in a radio map (1420 MHz) of
the Cygnus X region, this
ringlike structure looks highly symmetric, and has a diameter
of ∼ 3.′2. In a pioneer paper based on
continuum and Hi observations, Higgs et al. (1994)
have shown the thermal nature of the continuum
emission, and suggested that the ringlike

– 4 –

nebula is an ionized shell of swept-up
interstellar material; in addition, a possible Hi bubble
is reported at a systemic velocity (LSR) of
∼ −3 km s−1. By assuming a normal gas to
dust ratio, the atomic mass is not enough to account for
the extinction measured, and hence
a signiﬁcant amount of molecular gas is predicted. After
examining the IRAS High
Resolution images, Waters et al. (1996) concluded that G79.29+0.46 is a
detached shell due
to an epoch of high mass loss (∼ 5 10−4 M⊙ yr−1), followed by a more quiet
period. They
have estimated a shell mass of ∼14 M⊙, and measured a dust temperature of 60 – 77 K.
This picture is consistent with the LBV nature of G79.29+0.46’s exciting star, where some
diﬀerent
events of mass-loss may have occurred in the recent past.

The central star of G79.29+0.46 has been
spectroscopically studied at the optical and
the near-infrared wavelengths (Waters et al. 1996;
Voors et al. 2000). Its LBV classiﬁcation
is supported by a high luminosity (> 105 L⊙) and a
currently high mass-loss rate (> 10−6 M⊙
yr−1). Its galactic longitude is not adequate to estimate a
reliable kinematic distance; even so,
Voors et al. (2000) derived a value of ≈ 2 kpc. This is close
to 1.7 kpc, the estimated distance
to Cygnus OB2 (Massey & Thompson 1991), a huge OB association
which G79.29+0.46 may
belong to. G79.29+0.46 is behind the Great Cygnus Rift, projected 9′ to the
north-west of
the star-forming region DR15, which causes high visual extinction (up to 16 mag;
Kn¨odlseder
2000), and where an important amount of diﬀuse CO were reported (Schneider et al. 2006,
and references therein).

The aim of this work is to detect and to make a ﬁrst morphological and
dynamical
analysis of the molecular gas associated to G79.29+0.46. Below we present the results of
surveys in the rotational lines of CO J = 2 → 1 and 3 → 2, and 13CO J = 2 → 1
surrounding the LBV
ring nebula. The obtained results encourage to make further studies
about dynamics, excitation and
the possible relationship between the molecular gas detected
and the ring nebula.

2. Observations
The observations were made with the Submillimeter Telescope (SMT), located on Mount
Graham, Arizona.
The telescope is a 10.4 m diameter primary with a nutating secondary.
Design, optics and structural
aspects of the telescope have been extensively described by
Baars et al. (1999). The single-
polarization receiver SIS-230 was used to observe the CO
and 13CO J = 2 → 1 line emission; on the
other hand, the CO J = 3 → 2 line was observed
using the dual-channel SIS-345 receiver. The three
lines were mapped in several ∼ 4′×4′ ﬁelds
around G79.29+0.46, using on-the-ﬂy mode, with a ﬁxed
position (empty of line emission)
as the reference. Several on-the-ﬂy maps were later averaged in
order to get a ﬁnal rms as

– 5 –

low as possible. The scanning directions and starting positions
were diﬀerent each time to
reduce stripping. The Table 1 summarizes some parameters of the
observations; for each
line, the table indicates the frequency, angular resolution (HPBW), main-beam
eﬃciency
and ﬁnal rms of the maps.

The receivers were tuned for double-sideband operation, assuming
a sideband ratio
of 1 for the system temperature calibration. The receivers were calibrated with
ambient-
temperature and liquid nitrogen-cooled absorbing loads to determine the receiver noise tem-
perature; calibration of the ﬁnal data have uncertainties below 20 %. These measurements
were made
each time a receiver was tuned and at intervals of a few hours thereafter. Sys-
tem temperatures
were measured with the standard sky/ambient temperature load method
(Kutner & Ulich 1981).
Calibrations were performed every 15-20 minutes to track variations
in atmospheric opacity. Typical
single-sideband system temperatures during the observations
were in the range 250 − 400 K for the
1.3 mm lines and 1200 − 2000 K for the 0.8 mm line, de-
pending on the elevation and atmospheric
opacity. Two acousto-optic spectrometers (AOS)
have been used as backends. The AOS have 2048
channels, and a frequency resolution of
480 kHz, providing a velocity resolution of 0.6 (0.4) km s−1
in the 1.3 mm (0.8 mm) bands,
and bandwidths wide enough for galactic emission. The pointing was
checked within 2 hr on
a planet or other bright continuum source using the integrated line
intensity. Corrections
to the expected positions for the pointing model were not more than 4′′ in
either azimuth
or elevation. Planet observations were also used to check the main beam eﬃciency at
the
observed frequencies, which are also listed in Table 1. Throughout all the paper, the tem-
peratures are on a main-beam scale (TMB), and the velocities refer to the Local Standard of
Rest
system (VLSR).

3. Results: emission maps around G79.29+0.46

Figure 1 shows a panel of the emission
maps corresponding to the CO J = 2 → 1 line.
To provide a ﬁrst-look morphological comparison with
G79.29+0.46, the circle in the center
of each map roughly traces the external border of the ring
nebula (Higgs et al. 1994). At
ﬁrst sight, we note that large-scale emission dominates all the
observed ﬁeld, mostly at the
2.4 km s−1 map. Despite of this, some minor-scale features can be
observed, such as the
unresolved arc at the southwest, around (−80”, −110”). This arc is present in
a wide range
of velocities, and bounds part of the ring nebula. The inner part of the circle is
ﬁlled by
some low-level emission, especially in the range -3 to +5 km s−1. The emission at the ﬁrst
and last maps do not appear morphologically linked to the ring nebula.

Figure 2 sketches the 13CO J
= 2 → 1 emission in a similar fashion to Fig. 1. With the

– 6 –

aim of reducing the map noise, a
2-D hanning ﬁltering has been applied to build the ﬁgure.
This ﬁltering slightly reduces the angular
resolution of the map down to 45”. In general, the
emission of this isotopomer is well correlated
with the most intense CO emission in Fig. 1.
Similarly, besides the most intense emission at the
southeastern corner of the observed ﬁeld,
minor scale feature are also noticed. A systematic
deviation of the contours is visible toward
the north, north-east, and south-west of the plotted
circle. Another outstanding feature of
Fig. 2 is the lack of emission in the ﬁrst, second, and last
maps; as this behaviour can not
be explained merely by the sensitivity of the map, it clearly
indicates that the CO opacity
is relatively higher at the central velocities (i.e., in the range −3
to +10 km s−1), where the
isotopic ratio [CO]/[13CO] is lower, when compared with the more extreme
velocities plotted
in Fig. 2.

The emission maps of the CO J = 3 → 2 line are shown in Fig. 3. Due
to a higher
velocity resolution, the twelve maps of the ﬁgure span the same velocity range as those
of
Figs. 1 and 2. With the exception of the last map (11.4 km s−1), the emission concentrates
on the
central velocities, mainly on the six central maps. Some extended emission appears
at -0.5 and 1.2
km s−1, while in the following three maps the CO J = 3 → 2 emission is
concentrated outside the ring
nebula. Especially outstanding is again the southwest feature;
it has the highest level of the maps
(above 10 K on a TMB scale), remains unresolved at 345
GHz, and is widely extended in velocity.

4.
Linking the CO to G79.29+0.46: distance, morphology, kinematics

The ﬁeld of G79.29+0.46 is immersed
into Cyg X, a major star-forming region which
contains large amounts of molecular gas having
densities of some 103 cm−3 (Schneider et al.
2006). More speciﬁcally, G79.29+0.46 is projected close
in the sky (only 9′) to the smaller
star-forming region DR 15, although it is not clear if they are
physically connected. DR 15
is located at 1.7 ± 0.3 kpc (Schneider et al. 2006). The distance to
G79.29+0.46, however,
is hard to obtain with similar precision due to the uncertainties in the
stellar parameters,
In this sense, Voors et al. (2000) has made an important
dependent on its
classiﬁcation.
contribution, providing a distance in the range 1 to 4 kpc, with a likely value of 2
kpc, close
to the distance of DR 15.

Thus, the CO emission presumably linked to G79.29+0.46 are
expected to be heavily
contaminated by foreground/background emission from DR 15 or Cyg X as a
whole. More-
over, contribution from the solar neighbourhood does not have to be disregarded (mostly
in the J = 2 → 1 lines), due to the velocities involved, close to cero. As we have seen in
Figs. 1,
2, and 3, most of the CO emission is dominated by large-scale emission which ﬁlls all

– 7 –

the
mapped area. From a visual inspection to the low resolution maps of Oka et al. (2001),
we can relate
our large-scale CO emission –which increases towards the southeast– with the
molecular cloud around
DR 15. Furthermore, in the wide ﬁeld MSX and SCUBA images of
Redman et al. (2003) we can clearly
associate the CO emission to the higher column densi-
ties of dust. In principle, we can therefore
think about the large-scale emission detected in
our maps as arising from the foreground/background
emission associated to the molecular
cloud where DR 15 is embedded.

It is also expected that the CO
gas associated to the ring nebula should have minor-scale
features, and be morphologically connected
to the ring nebula. Thus, in order to propose a
link between the observed CO and G79.29+0.46, we
should look at the smaller-scale features.
In this sense, the southwestern clump is the most
prominent feature, visible in all the maps.
Other minor scale features can be inferred by the local
deviations of the contours already
referred to in Sect. 3. In order to better distinguish the local
features presumably associated
to the ring nebula, we have removed a plane emission (i.e., a
polynomial of order 1 in both
celestial coordinates) for each velocity channel, in the three
observed lines. These planes
have been ﬁtted by a least-square method to the whole ﬁeld, taking the
external zone of
the ﬁeld as input, and assuming that every feature outside ≈ 160′′ is purely
associated to
the foreground/background emission. The results are presented in Fig. 4, where
integrated
velocity maps in two diﬀerent velocity ranges (+1.3 to +4.8 km s−1 at panels 4a to 4c;
−3.0 to −1.3 km s−1 at panels 4d to 4f) are shown for each line. Both the positive and
negative
velocity ranges have been selected to better show the minor-scale features of the
CO emission. The
molecular emission is shown by contours, superposed on an ISO 25 µm-
image in grayscale (Trams et
al. 1997).

The distribution of the background-substracted emission is now closely following the
ring-shaped geometry of the infrared nebula. At the positive velocity range (Figs. 4a to 4c)
the
most prominent feature is the southwest clump, clearly visible in both CO lines. The CO
J = 3 → 2
line emission also has lower level contour emission bordering the external part of
the nebula. The
lack of a 13CO counterpart of the southwestern clump may be due to the
background removal method,
because the intensity of the local feature may be comparable
to the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁtted large-
scale plane. Strikingly, at negative velocities (Figs. 4d
to 4f), the emission of the three lines
closely match the infrared nebula, especially in the
western half of the ring. The peak of the
emission is again at the southwest, but at an inner
position with respect to the southwestern clump
at positive velocities.

The morphological coincidence of the small-scale features of the CO
emission with the
infrared ring nebula encourages their mutual association. At the best of our
knowledge, the
CO J = 1 → 0 and J = 2 → 1 observations presented in AG Car is the only LBV nebula
– 8 –

where a molecular counterpart has been reported (Nota et al. 2002). In that paper, however,
no maps were constructed and it is hard to determine if the morphology of the CO resembles
or not
that found in our data. Moreover, the low-J lines may contain important amounts of
diﬀuse,
background or foreground gas. In G79.29+0.46, the small-scale features that more
clearly are
correlated to the ring nebula are those of the J = 3 → 2 line (Fig. 4c and 4f),
and they are also
the most intense. If we also take into account the higher critical density
of the J = 3 → 2 line
(some 104 cm−3), compared to the low-J lines, we can think about a
scenario where high density
molecular gas has more chances to survive in harsh environments,
dominated by strong and variable
stellar winds and UV ﬁelds from the massive progenitor
star.

The kinematics of the local gas was
studied by position-velocity maps across selected
strips. On many of them, we could not detect any
sign of expansion or rotation of the CO
gas. The dominant velocities across the ﬁeld are from −2 to
0 km s−1, with almost no
systematic variations or gradients. This is, on the other hand, the
velocity range where most
of the low-resolution emission was reported as arising from DR 15 (Oka et
al. 2001). An
outstanding exception to this general trend is shown in Fig. 5. This ﬁgure was
constructed
by selecting the strip indicated in Fig. 4c, along a northeast to southwest direction
(exactly
45◦ from north to east). The slice was selected to pass through the southwest arc (at ∼
260′′
in Fig. 5), where a sudden broadening occurs. This broadening grows up to 14 km s−1 (from
−2
to +12 km s−1), and is limited to an angular extension comparable to the beamsize. It is
also
noticeable that the CO velocity shifts when the strip passes from the inner to the outer
region of
the nebula, i.e., when passes through the southwest arc.

The feature displayed in Fig. 5 is a
dynamical indicator of a low-velocity shock, acting
beyond the ionized ring nebula at a projected
velocity of 14 km s−1. This assumption is
supported by two facts: ﬁrstly, the region aﬀected by the
broadening is relatively thin,
because it is unresolved by our beam; and secondly, there is no
smooth variations of the
velocity between the inner and the outer regions. An important, additional
argument is
provided by the fact that there is no CO emission arising from DR 15 or other close
objects,
above 10 km s−1; in this sense, the Fig. 4c of Oka et al. (2001) is ellocuent, showing no
features at velocities above 10 km s−1. In other words, the CO velocity outside the ring
nebula is
locally exceptional, and it may only be explained by some kind of interaction with
the LBV-candidate
star. The presence of shocked gas close to the hot star encourages its
association and explains its
own existence, because the (relatively) recent mass eruptions
and variable winds after the main
sequence may have produced some sort of features like
the ones recognized in the molecular
circumstellar gas.

As were mentioned in the introduction, an increasing number of hydrodynamical
sim-

– 9 –

ulations are predicting the presence of several shocks in the environs of evolved
massive
stars (Garc´ıa-Segura et al. 1996; van Marle et al. 2004). This shocked region is certainly
of particular interest, because it may constitute a good laboratory to test these theoretical
predictions. This is especially true when we take into account the multiple layers reported
by Rizzo
et al. (2003c) surrounding a Wolf-Rayet nebula (NGC 2359), where a previous LBV
stage was assigned
as the responsible of such layers. The chemistry of the molecular gas in
the southwestern clump may
also be of particular interest, with a scenario characterized by
a shocked cloud, and close to a
highly-obscured, hot, and evolved star.

The velocity range of the unshocked CO (from −3 to +1 km
s−1) is –within the un-
certainties of the observations and the expected dispersion– coincident with
the Hi hole’s
systemic velocity reported by Higgs et al. (1994). This Hi counterpart may represent
the
main sequence signature of the star progenitor, as in many other cases of the Galaxy (see,
for
example, Arnal et al. 1999; Rizzo et al. 2001a; Cichowolski et al. 2003). These velocities
do not
diﬀer too much to those of the metal lines (Voors et al. 2000) and Brα (Waters et al.
1996) from the
star 1.

Below we discuss the particular physical conditions of the molecular gas linked to
G79.29+0.46, and also provide some quantitave arguments about its possible origin.

5. Discussion
5.1. Physical parameters: the LVG approach

As we mentioned in the earlier sub-section, the detected
molecular gas should have
physical conditions which are diﬀerent to those of the general ISM. The
detected CO may
simply be interstellar gas accumulated by the stellar wind, the results of several
ejecta, or
the relics of the parent molecular cloud, aﬀected by the destructive action of UV
radiation
and/or pushing wind. An estimate of the molecular mass, together with the neutral atomic
and the ionized gas masses, may complete the energetic balance related to the mechanical
input from
the exciting star. Other local parameters, such as the gas temperature or the
density, will help to
better describe the physical conditions in the studied region.

In a wide variety of galactic
scenarios, CO was found to be close to LTE but having a
high opacity (Lequeux 2005). From the most
common values of the CO to 13CO J = 2 → 1

1Note that, in both papers, the conversion from
heliocentric to LSR reference systems were made in the
wrong sense, and consequently the star and
nebular velocities result to be ∼ 34 km s−1 higher than the
published ones.

– 10 –

line ratio
(between 3 and 5 when 13CO is detected) we conﬁrm that both CO lines are
optically thick.
Furthermore, the high intensity of the CO J = 3 → 2 line (comparable or
even higher than the J = 2 →
1 line), indicates that we are dealing with densities (n(H2))
above 104 cm−3, and rotational
temperatures (Trot) of 40 K or more.

We can make a ﬁrst approach to the physical conditions of the
CO by using a LVG code
to predict the observed intensities and line ratios. In order to compare the
LVG modelling
with the observations, we have used the line-integrated maps already shown in Fig. 4
in the
two velocity intervals. The CO J = 3 → 2 map has been convolved to the J = 2 → 1 angular
resolution to work with a directly comparable TMB scale. The CO to 13CO J = 2 → 1 line
ratio varies
from 2 to 8, while the CO J = 3 → 2 to 2 → 1 line ratio (hereafter referred to
as Rexc) varies from
0.3 to 1.7 on a TMB scale in both velocity intervals.

After analyzing the emission in all the
lines, as well as the line ratios, we have proceeded
with the LVG modelling by choosing
characteristic regions within the observed ﬁeld. These
regions are indicated in Fig. 6, and the
meanings are as follows:

Region A: It contains the most intense emission from the southwestern
clump in the (1.3,
4.8) km s−1 velocity interval. This region may have representative values for
both the total
mass and n(H2) of the emission at positive velocities.

Region B: This region
corresponds to the maximum Rexc in both velocity intervals, and
points out the maximum densities
expected in the whole area.

Region C: This region comprises most of the emission at negative
velocities (excluding region
B), coincident with the ring nebula. It may represent the most common
physical conditions
in the velocity interval (-3, -1.3) km s−1, and may contain most of the mass.
Region D: This is a control region, with no signiﬁcant features associated to the ring nebula.
This
is built just to compare the results of LVG modelling with the other regions, and to
check the
validity of the method.

The four regions deﬁned are sketched in Fig. 6 superposed to the
distribution of Rexc in
the (1.3, 4.8) km s−1 velocity interval in greyscale, and to some contours
of the CO J = 3 → 2
emission in both velocity intervals (see caption). Note that greyscale peaks at
region B and
not at region A, where the line intensity is higher for positive velocities.
Qualitatively, region
B might have a higher density but lower mass than the region A, where we have
found the
CO absolute peak and a high (but not the highest) Rexc.

We have modelled the CO emission
for diﬀerent values of the kinetic temperature (Tk),
namely 40, 70, and 100 K. For a given Tk, we
have used the 13CO J = 2 → 1 line intensity
and Rexc as input, and thus predicted the 13CO column
density (N(13CO)) and n(H2).

– 11 –

According to the method, N(13CO) is most sensitive to the
line intensity, and does not vary
too much with Tk (Lequeux 2005). The obtained values for N(13CO)
and n(H2) were later
introduced to obtain the line opacities and excitation temperatures. The CO
column density
(N(CO)) was obtained from N(13CO) by assuming a CO to 13CO relative abundance of 70
(Wilson & Matteucci 1992). Finally, the total molecular mass was derived from N(CO), by
assuming a
CO abundance of 8 10−5, a distance of 1.7 kpc, and including the correction for
the presence of He
and other elements. The results from the LVG modelling are summarized
in Table 2. For each velocity
interval, we have indicated the region, its angular size, the
assumed Tk, and the obtained values
for n(H2), N(CO), and the total molecular mass.
Finally, the last column provided a brief
description of each region.

The visual absorption AV measured towards G79.29+0.46 varies from 12
(Trams et al.

1999) to 15 mag (Voors et al. 2000). By assuming a crude gas-to-dust ratio of

N(HI)
+ 2 N(H2) ∼ 1021AV

we derive N(H2) ≤ 6 − 7.5 1021 cm−2. For a normal CO abundance (8 10−5), a
general
N(CO) value of ≤ 5 − 6 1017 cm−2 is expected. The values of N(CO) obtained in our
control
regions are one order of magnitude lower, which may indicate that most of the local
gas is in atomic
phase (both neutral and ionized). Moreover, the densities of the control
regions are the lowest of
the table, which again reinforces the proposed link of the molecular
gas characterized by the
regions A, B, and C. While the densities of region D are around
103 cm−3, the values for the other
regions show and enhancement of one or two orders of
magnitude.

The total mass at positive
velocities rounds 8 M⊙, roughly distributed between clumps
A (5 M⊙) and B (3 M⊙). At negative
velocities, a total mass of 5 M⊙ is computed, dis-
tributed between the clump B (1.5 M⊙) and the
northwestern arc (3.5 M⊙). The missing
mass of the method, mostly due to the reduction of the
velocity intervals and to the selected
regions, is in any case lower than 2 M⊙. These masses fall
within the range of those ex-
pected in LBV outbursts (Smith & Owocki 2006), and to other veriﬁed
mass eruptions like
in η Carina (Smith et al. 2003), or P Cyg (Meaburn 2001). Although the lack of
symmetry
of the associated CO is puzzling, the hypothesis of mass ejections as the origin of such
struc-
tures is worth to be considered in the future. A follow-up study should be carried out to
observe other emission lines at higher frequencies or larger telescopes, capable of resolving
the
southwestern structure. The dominant physical processes may also be inferred by getting
information
from molecular tracers of shocks and PDRs.

The assumed Tk is surely not uniform along the whole
ﬁeld: probably, the emission
at negative velocities is better described by higher Tk than the
regions emitting at positive
velocities. As expected, the column densities are almost independent
from Tk, and the

– 12 –

variations are well below the observational uncertainties. The 13CO J = 2
→ 1 line was
found to be optically thin in all cases. However, both CO lines are optically thick;
the
J = 3 → 2 line systematically has a larger opacity than the J = 2 → 1 line, which
may result in
larger values of Rexc, and consequently n(H2). The 13CO J = 2 → 1 line
is subthermally excited in
all cases. For positive velocities, the LVG modelling needs an
excitation temperature above 40 K,
indicating a Tk well above such value. In fact, ﬁtting
was impossible in region B for Tk = 40 K.
5.2. On the origin of the detected molecular gas

The high densities found in the ﬁeld, particularly
in the regions A and B, strengthen the
hypothesis of several shockfronts acting upon the
circumstellar medium around G79.29+0.46.
A set of shockfronts is the natural consequence of the
presence of diﬀerent wind regimes
during star evolution, and the probable occurence of mass
eruptions (Garc´ıa-Segura et al.
1996; van Marle et al. 2004). So far, it is important to associate
the diﬀerent features with
speciﬁc evolutive stages of the star progenitor.

We can deal with a
rough estimate of the age of the high-density gas, by taking into
account the morphology and
kinematics presented above. For an assumed distance of 1.7
kpc, the southwestern clump is projected
at a distance of ∼ 1 pc. A lower limit for the shock
velocity would be 14 km s−1, the magnitude of
the “jump” in Fig. 5. By adopting these
values, a crude estimate of the dynamical time would be
tdyn <

R
Vshock

=

1 pc

14 km s−1 ≃ 7 × 104 yr.

This value of tdyn should be regarded as a loose
upper limit for the age of the shock, mainly
due to the fact that: (i) the present shock velocity
may be higher than 14 km s−1, because
this is the most conservative value, and just a radial
projection of the real shock velocity;
(ii) the shock might have started with values of several
hundreds of km s−1, and then have
been decelerated when travelling into the circumstellar gas. If
this were the case, the real age
would be one order of magnitude lower. By looking at the high
regularity of the torus-like
nebula, a reasonable value for the age of the structure may be below
104 yr, perhaps some
103 yr.

The youth of this structure allows us to associate the molecular
shockfront with the
actual LBV phase, which might have experienced several episodes of mass ejection
in the
near past. As the material is indeed more disperse than, for example, η Carina, we can
speculate about two possibilities: (i) G79.29+0.46 is older than η Carina, and hence has
had more
time to disperse its surroundings; or (ii) the energy involved in G79.29+0.46 is

– 13 –

greater
than in η Carina. The ﬁrst hypothesis seems more plausible, because of the size of
the circumstellar
material associated to G79.29+0.46, and because recent, violent eruptions
of η Carina have been
recorded in the 19th century. Even so, it is interesting to explore both
possibilities, as well as
to go deep into a comparison of both objects, in order to shed some
light on the interplay between
these type of stars and their outskirts.

6. Conclusions

A region of 4′ × 4′ in the ﬁeld of the
ring nebula G79.29+0.46 has been mapped in the
CO J = 2 → 1 and 3 → 2, and the 13CO J = 2 → 1
emission lines, with a maximum angular
resolution of 24′′, equivalent to ∼ 0.2 pc at an assumed
distance of 1.7 kpc. We report for the
ﬁrst time the detection of a mid-J CO emission line from the
surroundings of a LBV nebula.
Provided the excitation conditions of the CO J = 3 → 2 line, the
studied gas is presumably
warm (more than 33 K) and dense (above some 104 cm−3). As a ﬁrst result of
this work,
it is shown that not all the molecular gas is destroyed during massive star evolution,
and
consequently we are dealing with a new laboratory where one can learn about the mass-loss
phenomena associated to the brief LBV stage.

The CO emission is dominated by large scale features,
which uniformly increases towards
the southeast; this background/foreground emission is probably
associated to DR 15, due to
its close location and the velocity range of emission. Minor scale
features, however, show a
morphology completely diﬀerent, dominated by a large arc which coincides
with more than
half of the infrared ring nebula, and bounding it at a projected distance of up to
1pc. This
emission is particularly intense (in the J = 3 → 2 line) towards the southwest, where a
more
conspicuous zone is embedded. Moreover, there is a shockfront of a projected velocity of 14
km
s−1 acting precisely in this southwestern clump.

We have predicted the observed line emission by
LVG modelling. A minimum Tk of
40 K was determined in an extended area which have densities of the
order of 104 cm−3.
Immersed within this plateau, there are two outstanding clumps (regions A and B),
which
have densities well above 105 cm−3 and probably a higher Tk.

The total molecular mass
associated to the nebula is ∼ 13 to 15 M⊙, while the clump
masses are about 5 M⊙ each. Most of the
gas may result from the surviving parent molecular
cloud, later compressed by steady stellar winds
and radiation pressure. The origin of the
clumps may be diﬀerent, and we can not roule out the
existence of recent mass eruptions.
The higher density, the presence of a shockfront and the mass
involved may be indicators of
violent events, produced ∼ 104 yr ago, or less. This fact, together
with the high symmetry

– 14 –

of the nebula, points to an LBV origin of the feature.

This study
of the molecular component directly associated to the LBV stage may help to
understand the recent
past of G79.29+0.46, and therefore the evolutive mechanisms of this
kind of objects. So far, it is
worth making more observational eﬀorts in order to resolve the
emission, particulary in the clump.
The diﬀerences between regions A and B are puzzling,
and may indicate the existence of more than one
mass eruption in the recent past of the
progenitor of G79.29+0.46. A follow-up study of complex
molecules should also be carried
out, because they can provide information about the physical
parameters in detail. The
chemistry of the molecular gas in this region may also be of particular
interest, with a
scenario characterized by a shocked cloud, and close to a highly-obscured, hot, and
evolved
star. An abundance study of such molecules may point to the dominant emission mechanisms
in
the zone, which can be related to the ionized and atomic neutral gas, together with the
hot
circumstellar dust. Finally, other surveys of CO emission in LBVs and other evolved
massive stars
will also help to understand how frequent the mass eruptions are in this class
of objects, and how
important they are when compared to the steady high mass loss and to
the UV destructive radiation.

ABSTRACT
We present for the ﬁrst time the detection of mid-
JCO line emission in the
outskirts of anevolved massive star, which indicates the presence of warm
and/or
high density molecular gas. Aiming to learn about the interplay betwee n evolved
massive
stars and their surroundings, we have carried out CO J= 2→1,
J= 3→2, and13COJ= 2→1 line observations
in a 4′×4′ﬁeld around
the ring nebula G79.29+0.46, which is illuminated by a strong candidate t o

star. Thewholeﬁeldshowsextended predominant emissioninbothCO and13CO

probably comes from the large cloud which contains the
star forming region DR15. When this large-
scale emission is removed, minor
scales features become evident, particularly in the CO J= 3→2 line,
strikingly
coincident with the ring nebula. The high critical density of CO J= 3→2
(some 104cm−3)
gives additional support for the association with the massive
star, since high density molecular gas
has more chances to survive in such a harsh
environment. This structure may have been produced by
the cumu lative eﬀect
of a strong steady wind in the LBV stage or earlier, which has compre ssed the

surviving parent molecular cloud. In addition, immersed within this CO f eature,
we have also
discovered a higher density clump (at least several ∼105cm−3),
unresolved by the telescope and
probably having a higher kinetic tem perature.
Towards the clump, the presence of a jump of 14 −16
km s−1in the gas velocity
may indicate the existence of a shockfront. This clump may have bee n
created by
at least one mass eruption, 103−104yr ago. Thus, this work shows that not all
the
molecular gas is destroyed during massive star evolution, and co nsequently
we are dealing with a
new laboratory where one can learn about the ma ss-loss
phenomena associated to the brief LBV stage.

1. Introduction
Massive stars are the most inﬂuent
sources in the dynamical and ch emical evolution
of the galactic interstellar medium (ISM). Although
relatively few in nu mber, massive stars
are the most powerful, the fastest in the evolutionary
paths and t he richest from a chemical
viewpoint. Mass-loss phenomena (strong and dense winds,
violent m ass ejections) and a
very intense UV ﬁeld provide a signiﬁcant input to their surroundings
, which heats, ionizes,
dissociates, blows out, shocks and enriches the ISM as a whole.
According to
current evolutionary models (see, for example, Maed er & Meynet 1994;
Langer et al. 1994), the main
sequence of massive stars lasts seve ral 106yr, while the Wolf-
Rayet stage takes some 105yr. All
intermediate stages last typically from 103to several
104yr. Stellar winds, size, eﬀective
temperature and UV ﬂux vary durin g each phase by
orders of magnitude, while the stellar luminosity
remains almost const ant. When these
changes occur, a number of diﬀerent structures in the circumste
llar/interstellar gas should
be produced. Numerical simulations (Garc´ ıa-Segura et al. 1996; v an
Marle et al. 2004) pre-
dict the formation of several shockfronts in the ISM at scales fro m tenths
to tens of pc.
The possibility of mass eruptions at the intermediate and unstable st ages may also
add a
signiﬁcant contribution to the nebular mass (Smith & Owocki 2006).
So far, the study of the
ISM surrounding massive stars constitut es an excellent method
to know about the evolutive history
of the exciting source, becaus e it is expected that
diﬀerent evolutive stages would put their
“ﬁngerprints” in the circu mstellar material. Both
neutral and ionized gas have been widely observed
in the last decade s, and today we can
recognize many interstellar bubbles associated to the Main
Sequenc e (Arnal et al. 1999;

Cichowolski et al. 2003) and Wolf-Rayet nebulae (Miller & Chu 1993; Mo ore et al. 2000),
among
other galactic structures. In recent years, the hot dust surrounding massive stars was
the subject
of several near- and mid-IR observational campaign s, and we know about the
presenceofdisks,
torusandshellsaroundstarsatintermediatee volutivestages(Becklin et al.
1994; O’Hara et al. 2003).
The search for molecular gas in these environments is still limited, pos sibly due to the
a-priorihypothesis by which the parent molecular cloud around an evolved ma ssive star
may have been
destroyed soon after star formation. Even so, th e detected low-excitation
CO (Marston et al. 1999;
Nota et al. 2002; Rizzo et al. 2003a) is giving indications that the
molecular component would
represent an important contribution to the total mass of gas.
Unfortunately, the low- Jlines
observed to date trace densities as low as few 103cm−3, and
the link with the stars or the
circumstellar material can only be based on the morphology of
the CO structures, and not on any
other physical parameter.
A special and motivating case is NGC2359. To date, this is the only Wolf
-Rayet nebula
where H 2has been detected at 2 µm (St-Louis et al. 1998). Later, the global
distribution of
CO has been almost simultaneously mapped using the Kitt Peak (Rizzo e t al. 2001a)
and
SEST radiotelescopes (Cappa et al. 2001), showing an important am ount of molecular gas
surrounding the optical nebula. Follow-up studies have reported t he detection of complex
molecules
(Rizzo et al. 2001b, 2003b) and multiple layers of rather de nse gas ( ≃104cm−3;
Rizzo et al.
2003c). The origin of the molecular gas seems related to s tages previous to
Wolf-Rayet (dynamical
lifetimes tdyn∼104−105yr).
This signiﬁcant result encourages the search for molecular gas in th e
environs of evolved
massive stars which have not yet become Wolf-Rayet. Of those, th e luminous blue
vari-
able (LBV) stars are probably the best candidates, due to the “ins tantaneous” eﬀect of their
strongwindsandspectacularmassejectionsoverthestarsurro undings(Humphreys & Davidson
1994; Nota &
Clampin 1997). The nested shells observed in several c ases around LBV neb-
ulae span masses from
0.1 to 20 M ⊙, most of which come from short-lived eruptions, such as
the well known 19th century
outburst of ηCar (Smith & Owocki 2006). The multiple layer
structure discovered in NGC2359, referred
above, may have bee n formed during a previous
LBV stage.
A recent census provides a total of 12
conﬁrmed galactic LBV star s and 23 candidates
of such objects (Clark et al. 2005). G79.29+0.46
appears as a stro ng LBV candidate in the
sample. Noticed for the ﬁrst time by Wendker et al. (1991)
in a radio m ap (1420MHz) of
the Cygnus X region, this ringlike structure looks highly symmetric, a
nd has a diameter
of∼3.′2. In a pioneer paper based on continuum and Hiobservations, Higgs et al.
(1994)
have shown the thermal nature of the continuum emission, and sug gested that the ringlike

nebula is an ionized shell of swept-up interstellar material; in addition, a possible Hibubble
is reported at a systemic velocity (LSR) of ∼ −3 km s−1. By assuming a normal gas to
dust ratio, the
atomic mass is not enough to account for the extinc tion measured, and hence
a signiﬁcant amount of
molecular gas is predicted . After examining the IRAS High
Resolution images, Waters et al. (1996)
concluded that G79.29+0.46 is a detached shell due
to an epoch of high mass loss ( ∼510−4M⊙yr−1),
followed by a more quiet period. They
have estimated a shell mass of ∼14M⊙, and measured a dust
temperature of 60–77K.
This picture is consistent with the LBV nature of G79.29+0.46’s excitin g
star, where some
diﬀerent events of mass-loss may have occurred in the recent pas t.
The central
star of G79.29+0.46 has been spectroscopically studie d at the optical and
the near-infrared
wavelengths (Waters et al. 1996; Voors et al. 2 000). Its LBV classiﬁcation
is supported by a high
luminosity ( >105L⊙) and a currently high mass-loss rate ( >10−6M⊙
yr−1).
Itsgalacticlongitudeisnotadequatetoestimateareliablekinemat icdistance; evenso,
Voors et al. (2000)
derived a value of ≈2kpc. This is close to 1.7 kpc, the estimated distance
to Cygnus OB2 (Massey &
Thompson 1991), a hugeOB association wh ich G79.29+0.46may
belong to. G79.29+0.46 is behind the
Great Cygnus Rift, projected 9′to the north-west of
the star-forming region DR15, which causes high
visual extinction ( up to 16mag; Kn¨ odlseder
2000), and where an important amount of diﬀuse CO were
reported (Schneider et al. 2006,
and references therein).
The aim of this work is to detect and to
make a ﬁrst morphological and dynamical
analysis of the molecular gas associated to G79.29+0.46.
Below we pre sent the results of
surveys in the rotational lines of CO J= 2→1 and 3 →2, and13COJ=
2→1
surrounding the LBV ring nebula. The obtained results encourage t o make further studies
about
dynamics, excitation and the possible relationship between th e molecular gas detected
and the ring
nebula.
2. Observations
TheobservationsweremadewiththeSubmillimeter Telescope(SMT), locatedonMount
Graham, Arizona. The telescope is a 10.4 m diameter primary with a nut ating secondary.
Design,
optics and structural aspects of the telescope have bee n extensively described by
Baars et al.
(1999). The single-polarization receiver SIS-230 was u sed to observe the CO
and13COJ= 2→1 line
emission; on the other hand, the CO J= 3→2 line was observed
usingthedual-channelSIS-345receiver.

low as possible. The scanning directions and starting positions were d iﬀerent each time to
reduce stripping. The Table 1 summarizes some parameters of the o bservations; for each
line, the
table indicates the frequency, angular resolution (HPBW), main-beam eﬃciency
and ﬁnal rmsof the
maps.
The receivers were tuned for double-sideband operation, assumin g a sideband ratio
of 1 for
the system temperature calibration. The receivers were c alibrated with ambient-
temperature and
liquid nitrogen-cooled absorbing loads to determin e the receiver noise tem-
perature; calibration
of the ﬁnal data have uncertainties below 20 %. These measurements
were made each time a receiver
was tuned and at intervals of a few ho urs thereafter. Sys-
tem temperatures were measured with the
standard sky/ambient temperature load method
(Kutner & Ulich 1981). Calibrations were performed
every 15-20 min utes to track variations
inatmosphericopacity. Typicalsingle-sidebandsystemtemperatu
resduringtheobservations
were in the range 250 −400K for the 1.3mm lines and 1200 −2000K for the 0.8
mm line, de-
pending on the elevation and atmospheric opacity. Two acousto-op tic spectrometers
(AOS)
have been used as backends. The AOS have 2048 channels, and a fr equency resolution of
480
kHz, providing a velocity resolution of 0.6 (0.4) km s−1in the 1.3mm (0.8mm) bands,
and bandwidths
wide enough for galactic emission. The pointing was ch ecked within 2hr on
a planet or other bright
continuum source using the integrated line in tensity. Corrections
to the expected positions for the
pointing model were not more tha n 4′′in either azimuth
or elevation. Planet observations were also
used to check the main b eam eﬃciency at the
observed frequencies, which are also listed in Table 1.
Throughout a ll the paper, the tem-
peratures are on a main-beam scale ( TMB), and the velocities
refer to the Local Standard of
Rest system ( VLSR).
3. Results: emission maps around G79.29+0.46
Figure 1 shows a panel of the emission maps corresponding to the CO J= 2→1 line.
To provide a ﬁrst-
look morphological comparison with G79.29+0.46, t he circle in the center
of each map roughly traces
the external border of the ring nebula (Higgs et al. 1994). At
ﬁrst sight, we note that large-scale
emission dominates all the obse rved ﬁeld, mostly at the
2.4 km s−1map. Despite of this, some minor-
scale features can be observed, such as the
unresolved arc at the southwest, around ( −80”,−110”).
This arc is present in a wide range
of velocities, and bounds part of the ring nebula. The inner
part of t he circle is ﬁlled by
some low-level emission, especially in the range -3 to +5 km s−1.
The emission at the ﬁrst
and last maps do not appear morphologically linked to the ring nebula.

aim of reducing the map noise, a 2-D hanning ﬁltering has been applied t o build the ﬁgure.
This ﬁltering slightly reduces the angular resolution of the map down t o 45”. In general, the
emission of this isotopomer is well correlated with the most intense CO emission in Fig. 1.
Similarly, besides the most intense emission at the southeastern cor ner of the observed ﬁeld,
minor
scale feature are also noticed. A systematic deviation of the c ontours is visible toward
the north,
north-east, and south-west of the plotted circle. An other outstanding feature of
Fig. 2 is the lack
of emission in the ﬁrst, second, and last maps; as this behaviour can not
be explained merely by the
sensitivity of the map, it clearly indicates th at the CO opacity
is relatively higher at the
central velocities (i.e., in the range −3 to +10 km s−1), where the
isotopic ratio [CO]/[13CO] is
lower, when compared with the more extreme velocities plotted
in Fig. 2.
The emission maps of the CO
J= 3→2 line are shown in Fig. 3. Due to a higher
velocity resolution, the twelve maps of the ﬁgure
span the same velo city range as those of
Figs. 1 and 2. With the exception of the last map (11.4 km
s−1), the emission concentrates
on the central velocities, mainly on the six central maps. Some exte
nded emission appears
at -0.5 and 1.2 km s−1, while in the following three maps the CO J= 3→2
emission is
concentrated outside the ring nebula. Especially outstanding is aga in the southwest
feature;
it has the highest level of the maps (above 10K on a TMBscale), remains unresolved at 345
GHz, and is widely extended in velocity.
4. Linking the CO to G79.29+0.46: distance, morphology, kin
ematics
The ﬁeld of G79.29+0.46 is immersed into Cyg X, a major star-forming r egion which
contains
large amounts of molecular gas having densities of some 103cm−3(Schneider et al.
2006). More
speciﬁcally, G79.29+0.46 is projected close in the sky (o nly 9′) to the smaller
star-forming region
DR15, although it is not clear if they are physica lly connected. DR15
is located at 1 .7±0.3kpc
(Schneider et al. 2006). The distance to G79.29+0.46, howeve r,
is hard to obtain with similar
precision due to the uncertainties in the st ellar parameters,
dependent on its classiﬁcation. In
this sense, Voors et al. (2000) h as made an important
contribution, providing a distance in the
range 1 to 4kpc, with a likely v alue of 2kpc, close
to the distance of DR15.
Thus, the CO emission
presumably linked to G79.29+0.46 are expected to be heavily
contaminated by foreground/background
emission from DR15 or C ygX as a whole. More-
over, contribution from the solar neighbourhood does
not have to be disregarded (mostly
in theJ= 2→1 lines), due to the velocities involved, close to
cero. As we have seen in
Figs. 1, 2, and 3, most of the CO emission is dominated by large-scale e
mission which ﬁlls all
```

the mapped area. From a visual inspection to the low resolution maps of Oka et al. (2001),
we
can relate our large-scale CO emission –which increases towards t he southeast– with the
molecular
cloud around DR15. Furthermore, in the wide ﬁeld MSX and S CUBA images of
Redman et al. (2003) we
can clearly associate the CO emission to the h igher column densi-
ties of dust. In principle, we
can therefore think about the large-s cale emission detected in
our maps as arising from the
foreground/background emission ass ociated to the molecular
cloud where DR15 is embedded.
It is also
expected that the CO gasassociated to the ring nebula sho uld have minor-scale
features, and be
morphologically connected to the ring nebula. Thu s, in order to propose a
link between theobserved
CO andG79.29+0.46, we should lookatthe s maller-scale features.
In this sense, the southwestern
clump is the most prominent featu re, visible in all the maps.
Other minor scale features can be
inferred by the local deviations o f the contours already
referred to in Sect. 3. In order to better
distinguish the local fea tures presumably associated
to the ring nebula, we have removed a plane
emission (i.e., a polynomial o f order 1 in both
celestial coordinates) for each velocity channel,
in the three obse rved lines. These planes
have been ﬁtted by a least-square method to the whole
ﬁeld, taking the external zone of
the ﬁeld as input, and assuming that every feature outside
≈160′′is purely associated to
the foreground/background emission. The results are presente d in Fig.
4, where integrated
velocity maps in two diﬀerent velocity ranges (+1 .3 to +4.8 km s−1at panels 4a
to 4c;
−3.0 to−1.3 km s−1at panels 4d to 4f) are shown for each line. Both the positive and
negative
velocity ranges have been selected to better show the min or-scale features of the
CO emission. The
molecular emission is shown by contours, superpose d on an ISO 25 µm-
image in grayscale (Trams et
al. 1997).
The distribution of the background-substracted emission is now clo sely following the
ring-shaped geometry of the infrared nebula. At the positive veloc ity range (Figs. 4a to 4c)
the
most prominent feature is the southwest clump, clearly visible in b oth CO lines. The CO
J= 3→2 line
emission also has lower level contour emission bordering the exte rnal part of
the nebula. The lack
of a13CO counterpart of the southwestern clump may be due to the
background removal method, because
the intensity of the local f eature may be comparable
to the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁtted large-scale
plane. Strikingly, at ne gative velocities (Figs. 4d
to 4f), the emission of the three lines closely
match the infrared neb ula, especially in the
western half of the ring. The peak of the emission is
again at the sout hwest, but at an inner
position with respect to the southwestern clump at positive
velocitie s.
The morphological coincidence of the small-scale features of the CO emission with the
infrared ring nebula encourages their mutual association. At the b est of our knowledge, the
COJ=
1→0 andJ= 2→1 observations presented in AGCar is the only LBV nebula

where a molecular counterpart has been reported (Nota et al. 200 2). In that paper, however,
no maps were constructed and it is hard to determine if the morpholo gy of the CO resembles
or not
that found in our data. Moreover, the low- Jlines may contain important amounts of
diﬀuse,
background or foreground gas. In G79.29+0.46, the small- scale features that more
clearly are
correlated to the ring nebula are those of the J= 3→2 line (Fig. 4c and 4f),
and they are also the
most intense. If we also take into account the higher critical density
of theJ= 3→2 line (some
104cm−3), compared to the low- Jlines, we can think about a
scenariowherehighdensitymoleculargashasmorechancestosurv iveinharshenvironments,
dominated by strong
and variable stellar winds and UV ﬁelds from the m assive progenitor
star.
The kinematics of the
local gas was studied by position-velocity maps across selected
strips. On many of them, we could
not detect any sign of expansion o r rotation of the CO
gas. The dominant velocities across the ﬁeld
are from −2 to 0 km s−1, with almost no
systematic variations or gradients. This is, on the other
hand, the velocity range where most
of the low-resolution emission was reported as arising from DR15
(Ok a et al. 2001). An
outstanding exception to this general trend is shown in Fig. 5. This ﬁ gure
was constructed
by selecting the strip indicated in Fig. 4c, along a northeast to south west
direction (exactly
45◦from north to east). The slice was selected to pass through the so uthwest arc
(at ∼260′′
in Fig. 5), where a sudden broadening occurs. This broadening grow s up to 14 km s−1(from
−2 to +12 km s−1), and is limited to an angular extension comparable to the beamsize. I t is
also
noticeable that the CO velocity shifts when the strip passes fro m the inner to the outer
region of
the nebula, i.e., when passes through the southwest arc.
The feature displayed in Fig. 5 is a
dynamical indicator of a low-velocity shock, acting
beyond the ionized ring nebula at a projected
velocity of 14 km s−1. This assumption is
supported by two facts: ﬁrstly, the region aﬀected by the
broad ening is relatively thin,
because it is unresolved by our beam; and secondly, there is no smoo
th variations of the
velocity between the inner and the outer regions. An important, ad ditional
argument is
provided by the fact that there is no CO emission arising from DR15 or other close
objects,
above 10 km s−1; in this sense, the Fig. 4c of Oka et al. (2001) is ellocuent, showing no
features at velocities above 10 km s−1. In other words, the CO velocity outside the ring
nebula is
locally exceptional, and it may only be explained by some kind of in teraction with
the LBV-
candidate star. The presence of shocked gas close to th e hot star encourages its
association and
explains its own existence, because the (relatively) recent mass eruptions
and variable winds after
the main sequence may have produced some sort of features like
the ones recognized in the molecular
circumstellar gas.
As were mentioned in the introduction, an increasing number of hydr odynamical

ulations are predicting the presence of several shocks in the envir ons of evolved massive
stars (Garc´ ıa-Segura et al. 1996; van Marle et al. 2004). This sho cked region is certainly
of
particular interest, because it may constitute a good laborator y to test these theoretical
predictions. This is especially true when we take into account the mult iple layers reported
by
Rizzo et al. (2003c) surrounding a Wolf-Rayet nebula (NGC2359) , where a previous LBV
stage was
assigned as the responsible of such layers. The chemistr y of the molecular gas in
the southwestern
clump may also be of particular interest, with a sc enario characterized by
a shocked cloud, and
close to a highly-obscured, hot, and evolved s tar.
The velocity range of the unshocked CO (from −3
to +1 km s−1) is –within the un-
certainties of the observations and the expected dispersion– coin
cident with the Hihole’s
systemic velocity reported by Higgs et al. (1994). This Hicounterpart may
represent the
main sequence signature of the star progenitor, as in many other c ases of the Galaxy
(see,
for example, Arnal et al. 1999; Rizzo et al. 2001a; Cichowolski et al. 2003). These velocities
do not diﬀer too much to those of the metal lines (Voors et al. 2000) and Brα(Waters et al.
1996)
from the star1.
Below we discuss the particular physical conditions of the molecular g as linked to
G79.29+0.46, and also provide some quantitave arguments about its possible origin.
5. Discussion
5.1. Physical parameters: the LVG approach
As we mentioned in the earlier sub-section, the detected
molecular g as should have
physical conditions which are diﬀerent to those of the general ISM . The
detected CO may
simply be interstellar gas accumulated by the stellar wind, the results of several
ejecta, or
the relics of the parent molecular cloud, aﬀected by the destructiv e action of UV
radiation
and/or pushing wind. An estimate of the molecular mass, together w ith the neutral atomic
and the ionized gas masses, may complete the energetic balance rela ted to the mechanical
input from
the exciting star. Other local parameters, such as the gas temperature or the
density, will help to
better describe the physical conditions in the st udied region.
In a wide variety of galactic
scenarios, CO was found to be close to LT E but having a
high opacity (Lequeux 2005). From the most
common values of the C O to13COJ= 2→1
1Note that, in both papers, the conversion from heliocentric
to LSR reference systems were made in the
wrong sense, and consequently the star and nebular
velocities res ult to be ∼34 km s−1higher than the
published ones.

line ratio (between 3 and 5 when13CO is detected) we conﬁrm that both CO lines are
optically
thick. Furthermore, the high intensity of the CO J= 3→2 line (comparable or
even higher than the J=
2→1 line), indicates that we are dealing with densities ( n(H2))
above 104cm−3, and rotational
temperatures ( Trot) of 40K or more.
We can make a ﬁrst approach to the physical conditions of the
CO by using a LVG code
to predict the observed intensities and line ratios. In order to comp are the
LVG modelling
with the observations, we have used the line-integrated maps alrea dy shown in Fig. 4
in the
two velocity intervals. The CO J= 3→2 maphas been convolved to the J= 2→1 angular
resolution
to work with a directly comparable TMBscale. The CO to13COJ= 2→1 line
ratio varies from 2 to 8,
while the CO J= 3→2 to 2→1 line ratio (hereafter referred to
asRexc) varies from 0.3 to 1.7 on a
TMBscale in both velocity intervals.
After analyzing the emission in all the lines, as well as the
line ratios, we have proceeded
with the LVG modelling by choosing characteristic regions within the
ob served ﬁeld. These
regions are indicated in Fig. 6, and the meanings are as follows:
Region A: It
contains the most intense emission from the southwestern clump in the (1.3,
4.8) km s−1velocity
interval. This region may have representative values for bo th the total
mass and n(H2) of the
emission at positive velocities.
Region B: This region corresponds to the maximum Rexcin both
velocity intervals, and
points out the maximum densities expected in the whole area.
Region C: This
region comprises most of the emission at negative velocities (exc luding region
B), coincident with
the ring nebula. It may represent the most commo n physical conditions
in the velocity interval (-3,
-1.3) km s−1, and may contain most of the mass.
Region D: This is a control region, with no
signiﬁcant features associated to t he ring nebula.
This is built just to compare the results of LVG
modelling with the other regions, and to
check the validity of the method.
The four regions deﬁned
are sketched in Fig. 6 superposed to the d istribution of Rexcin
the(1.3, 4.8)kms−1velocity
intervalingreyscale, andtosomecontoursoftheCO J= 3→2
emission in both velocity intervals (see
caption). Note that greysca le peaks at region B and
not at region A, where the line intensity is
higher for positive velocities . Qualitatively, region
B might have a higher density but lower mass
than the region A, where we have found the
CO absolute peak and a high (but not the highest) Rexc.
We have modelled the CO emission for diﬀerent values of the kinetic tem perature ( Tk),
namely 40,
70, and 100K. For a given Tk, we have used the13COJ= 2→1 line intensity
andRexcas input, and thus
predicted the13CO column density ( N(13CO)) and n(H2).
```

According to the method, N(13CO) is most sensitive to the line intensity, and does not vary
too much with Tk(Lequeux 2005). The obtained values for N(13CO) and n(H2) were later
introduced to
obtain the line opacities and excitation temperatures . The CO column density
(N(CO)) was obtained
from N(13CO) by assuming a CO to13CO relative abundance of 70
(Wilson & Matteucci 1992). Finally,
the total molecular mass was der ived from N(CO), by
assuming a CO abundance of 8 10−5, a distance
of 1.7 kpc, and including the correction for
the presence of He and other elements. The results from
the LVG m odelling are summarized
in Table 2. For each velocity interval, we have indicated the
region, its angular size, the
assumed Tk, and the obtained values for n(H2),N(CO), and the total
molecular mass.
Finally, the last column provided a brief description of each region.
The visual
absorption AVmeasured towards G79.29+0.46 varies from 12 (Trams et al.
1999) to 15 mag (Voors et al.
2000). By assuming a crude gas-to-d ust ratio of
N(HI)+2N(H2)∼1021AV
we derive N(H2)≤6−7.5 1021cm−2.
For a normal CO abundance (8 10−5), a general
N(CO) value of ≤5−6 1017cm−2is expected. The values of
N(CO) obtained in our
control regions are one order of magnitude lower, which may indicat e that
most of the local
gas is in atomic phase (both neutral and ionized). Moreover, the de nsities of the
control
regions are the lowest of the table, which again reinforces the prop osed link of the
molecular
gas characterized by the regions A, B, and C. While the densities of r egion D are around
103cm−3, the values for the other regions show and enhancement of one or two orders of
magnitude.
The total mass at positive velocities rounds 8M ⊙, roughly distributed between clumps
A (5M ⊙) and B
(3M ⊙). At negative velocities, a total mass of 5M ⊙is computed, dis-
tributed between the clump B
(1.5M ⊙) and the northwestern arc (3.5M ⊙). The missing
mass of the method, mostly due to the
reduction of the velocity inte rvals and to the selected
regions, is in any case lower than 2M ⊙.
These masses fall within the range of those ex-
pected in LBV outbursts (Smith & Owocki 2006), and
to other veriﬁ ed mass eruptions like
inηCarina (Smith et al. 2003), or PCyg (Meaburn 2001).
Although the la ck of symmetry
of the associated CO is puzzling, the hypothesis of mass ejections a
s the origin of such struc-
tures is worth to be considered in the future. A follow-up study sho uld
be carried out to
observe other emission lines at higher frequencies or larger telesco pes, capable
of resolving
the southwestern structure. The dominant physical processes may also be inferred by
getting
information from molecular tracers of shocks and PDRs.
The assumed Tkis surely not uniform
along the whole ﬁeld: probably, the emission
at negative velocities is better described by higher
Tkthan the regions emitting at positive
velocities. As expected, the column densities are almost
independen t fromTk, and the

variations are well below the observational uncertainties. The13COJ= 2→1 line was
found to be
optically thin in all cases. However, both CO lines are optic ally thick; the
J= 3→2 line
systematically has a larger opacity than the J= 2→1 line, which
may result in larger values of Rexc,
and consequently n(H2). The13COJ= 2→1 line
is subthermally excited in all cases. For positive
velocities, the LVG mo delling needs an
excitation temperature above 40K, indicating a Tkwell above
such value. In fact, ﬁtting
was impossible in region B for Tk= 40K.
5.2. On the origin of the
detected molecular gas
The high densities found in the ﬁeld, particularly in the regions A and B,
strengthen the
hypothesisofseveral shockfrontsactinguponthecircumstellar mediumaroundG79.29+0.46.
A
set of shockfronts is the natural consequence of the presenc e of diﬀerent wind regimes
during star
evolution, and the probable occurence of mass eruptio ns (Garc´ ıa-Segura et al.
1996; van Marle et
al. 2004). So far, it is important to associate the diﬀerent features with
speciﬁc evolutive stages
of the star progenitor.
We can deal with a rough estimate of the age of the high-density gas , by
taking into
account the morphology and kinematics presented above. For an a ssumed distance of 1.7
kpc, the southwestern clump is projected at a distance of ∼1 pc. A lower limit for the shock
velocity would be 14 km s−1, the magnitude of the “jump” in Fig. 5. By adopting these
values, a
crude estimate of the dynamical time would be
tdyn<R
Vshock=1 pc
14 kms−1≃7×104yr.
This value of
tdynshould be regarded as a loose upper limit for the age of the shock, ma inly
due to the fact
that: ( i) the present shock velocity may be higher than 14 km s−1, because
this is the most
conservative value, and just a radial projection of the real shock velocity;
(ii) the shock might
have started with values of several hundreds of km s−1, and then have
been decelerated when
travelling into the circumstellar gas. If this w ere the case, the real age
would be one order of
magnitude lower. By looking at the high regularit y of the torus-like
nebula, a reasonable value for
the age of the structure may be belo w 104yr, perhaps some
103yr.
The youth of this structure allows
us to associate the molecular sho ckfront with the
actual LBV phase, which might have experienced
several episodes of mass ejection in the
near past. As the material is indeed more disperse than,
for examp le,ηCarina, we can
speculate about two possibilities: ( i) G79.29+0.46 is older than
ηCarina, and hence has
had more time to disperse its surroundings; or ( ii) the energy involved in
G79.29+0.46 is
```

greater than in ηCarina. The ﬁrst hypothesis seems more plausible, because of the s ize of
the circumstellar material associated to G79.29+0.46, and because recent, violent eruptions
ofηCarina have been recorded in the 19th century. Even so, it is intere sting to explore both
possibilities, as well as to go deep into a comparison of both objects, in order to shed some
light
on the interplay between these type of stars and their outskir ts.
6. Conclusions
A region of
4′×4′in the ﬁeld of the ring nebula G79.29+0.46 has been mapped in the
COJ= 2→1 and 3→2, and
the13COJ= 2→1 emission lines, with a maximum angular
resolution of 24′′, equivalent to ∼0.2 pc at an
assumed distance of 1.7 kpc. We report for the
ﬁrst time the detection of a mid- JCO emission line
from the surroundings of a LBV nebula.
Provided the excitation conditions of the CO J= 3→2 line, the
studied gas is presumably
warm (more than 33K) and dense (above some 104cm−3). As a ﬁrst result of
this work,
it is shown that not all the molecular gas is destroyed during massive s tar evolution,
and
consequently we are dealing with a new laboratory where one can lear n about the mass-loss
phenomena associated to the brief LBV stage.
TheCOemissionisdominatedbylargescalefeatures,
whichuniformlyin creasestowards
the southeast; this background/foreground emission is probably
associated to DR15, due to
its close location and the velocity range of emission. Minor scale featu
res, however, show a
morphology completely diﬀerent, dominated by a large arc which coinc ides with
more than
half of the infrared ring nebula, and bounding it at a projected dista nce of up to 1pc.
This
emission is particularly intense (in the J= 3→2 line) towards the southwest, where a more
conspicuous zone is embedded. Moreover, there is a shockfront o f a projected velocity of 14
km
s−1acting precisely in this southwestern clump.
We have predicted the observed line emission by LVG
modelling. A minimum Tkof
40K was determined in an extended area which have densities of the o rder
of 104cm−3.
Immersed within this plateau, there are two outstanding clumps (re gions A and B), which
have densities well above 105cm−3and probably a higher Tk.
The total molecular mass associated to
the nebula is ∼13 to 15M ⊙, while the clump
masses areabout5 M ⊙each. Most of thegasmay result
fromthe surviving parent molecula r
cloud, later compressed by steady stellar winds and radiation
press ure. The origin of the
clumps may be diﬀerent, and we can not roule out the existence of re
cent mass eruptions.
The higher density, the presence of a shockfront and the mass inv olved may be
indicators of
violent events, produced ∼104yr ago, or less. This fact, together with the high
symmetry

of the nebula, points to an LBV origin of the feature.
This study ofthemolecular component
directly associatedtothe LB Vstagemay helpto
understand the recent past of G79.29+0.46, and
therefore the e volutive mechanisms of this
kind of objects. So far, it is worth making more
observational eﬀor ts in order to resolve the
emission, particulary in the clump. The diﬀerences
between regions A and B are puzzling,
and may indicate the existence of more than one mass eruption
in the recent past of the
progenitor of G79.29+0.46. A follow-up study of complex molecules sh ould
also be carried
out, because they can provide information about the physical par ameters in detail.
The
chemistry of the molecular gas in this region may also be of particular in terest, with a
scenario characterized by a shocked cloud, and close to a highly-ob scured, hot, and evolved
star.
Anabundancestudyofsuchmolecules maypointtothedomina nt emissionmechanisms
in the zone, which can be
related to the ionized and atomic neutral ga s, together with the
hot circumstellar dust. Finally,
other surveys of CO emission in LBVs a nd other evolved
massive stars will also help to understand
how frequent the mass er uptions are in this class
of objects, and how important they are when
compared to the ste ady high mass loss and to
the UV destructive radiation.
