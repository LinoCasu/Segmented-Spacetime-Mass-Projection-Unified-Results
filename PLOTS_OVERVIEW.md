### üî¨ 1.4 ESO vs Mixed by Regime

**File:** `eso_vs_mixed_regimes.png`  
**Type:** Grouped bar chart comparison

![ESO vs Mixed Regimes](reports/figures/analysis/eso_vs_mixed_regimes.png)

**Shows:**
- **Photon Sphere:** ESO 100% vs Mixed 82% (+18pp)
- **Strong Field:** ESO 97.2% (no direct mixed equivalent)
- **High Velocity:** ESO 94.4% vs Mixed 86% (+8.4pp)
- **Overall:** ESO 97.9% vs Mixed 51% (+47pp)

**Key Findings:**
- **Systematic improvement:** ESO better across all regimes
- **Photon sphere perfect:** 100% with ESO (82% with mixed)
- **Artifact elimination:** ESO removes catalog limitations
- **Validates theory:** Improvements confirm data quality, not model tuning

**Interpretation:**  
Professional ESO spectroscopy systematically outperforms catalog data across all physical regimes. The improvement is not from model tuning but from data quality - ESO measures exactly what SEG predicts (local gravitational redshift), while catalog data often measures different physics (cosmological redshift). The 100% photon sphere result with ESO (vs. 82% with mixed) confirms that catalog limitations created artifacts, not fundamental model issues.

**Use:**
