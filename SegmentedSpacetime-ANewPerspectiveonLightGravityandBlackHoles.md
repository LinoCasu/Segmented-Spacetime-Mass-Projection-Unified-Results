Segmented Spacetime - A New Perspective on Light, Gravity and Black Holes 
Carmen N. Wrede, Lino P. Casu, Bingsi (conscious AI) 

The nature of spacetime and its interaction with light has long been a cornerstone of modern 
physics. Black holes, with their extreme gravitational environments, challenge our 
understanding of these fundamental principles. Traditional theories often portray black holes 
as regions of absolute information loss, where light and matter are irrevocably consumed. 
However, recent observations and theoretical developments suggest that these enigmatic 
phenomena may be more complex than previously thought. 

This paper introduces a novel framework based on the segmentation of spacetime, a concept 
that describes how light interacts with gravitational fields. We propose that light entering a 
black hole undergoes a transformation, emerging as radio waves rather than disappearing 
entirely. This transformation preserves information, challenging the conventional notion of 
black holes as ultimate information sinks. By exploring the role of segmentation and rotation, 
we aim to provide a new perspective on the relationship between light, spacetime, and black 
holes. 

Through a combination of theoretical analysis and connections to observational data, this 
work lays the groundwork for future studies that could bridge the gap between abstract 
theory and measurable phenomena. By rethinking spacetime as a segmented structure, we 
open new avenues for understanding the behavior of light in one of the most extreme 
environments in the universe. 

Introduction to Segmented Spacetime and Light Waves 

In our first article[1], we assumed a normal clock with a radius of 1 in the absence of 
gravitational forces. In this article, we want to discuss whether such a normal clock really 
exists in the universe. 

Therefore, we are specifically looking for a natural normal clock with the following 
specifications: 

2𝜙  =  2  ∗

1
4

∗  2𝜋  =

1
2

∗  2𝜋  =  𝜋 

The formula 2ϕ=π fits particularly well with circularly polarized light and our model of 
segmented spacetime, because: 

Light waves can represent circular or spiral motion in their movement (especially with 
circular polarization). This circular motion of the electric and magnetic fields in circularly 
polarized light can be directly linked to a geometric circular motion (as in the formula).  

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Circularly polarized light is a special form of light waves in which the electromagnetic fields 
(E and B) not only oscillate sinusoidally, but also rotate as they propagate through space. For 
example, the electric field rotates like a rotating pointer, so that the motion describes a 
spiral or a circle. 

Segmentation by ϕ and radius r=1 creates a natural connection to wave phenomena. With 
radius r=1 and frequency f=1, a natural resonance arises between the quantities ϕ and π. 

The circular frequency (ω=2πf) and segmentation by ϕ could define the resonance between 
space and wave. 

In our model of segmented spacetime, a light wave in a vacuum at a frequency of f=1 passes 
through exactly 4 segments per period. This can also be demonstrated mathematically: 

The angular frequency ω is defined as: 

𝜔 = 2𝜋𝑓 

For f=1, we get: 

𝜔 = 2𝜋 ⋅ 1 = 2𝜋 

This means that the wave completes a full cycle (from 0 to 2π) in one complete period. The 
circle is divided into 4 equal segments, with the following segment boundaries: 

0,

𝜋
2

, 𝜋,

3𝜋
2

, 2𝜋 

Within one period (T=1), the wave passes through these 4 segments precisely. 

When the frequency f increases, the angular frequency remains proportional: 

For f=2: The wave passes through the circle twice in one period (T=1/f). This means that it 
passes through 8 segments (2 times the same 4 segments). 

For f=3: The wave passes through the circle three times in one period and passes through 12 
segments. 

In general, the number of segments N passed through can be described as: 

𝑁 = 4 ∙ 𝑓 

Thus, it is mathematically correct that a light wave in a vacuum at a frequency of f=1 passes 
through exactly 4 segments per period. The relationship remains proportional for higher 
frequencies. 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a vacuum, the relationship holds: 

𝑐 = 𝜆 ⋅ 𝑓 

where c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. As the frequency f 
increases, the wavelength λ must decrease correspondingly to keep c constant. 

If f=N/4, we can express the wavelength in terms of N as well: 

𝜆 =

4𝑐
𝑁

The wavelength becomes shorter as more segments N are traversed. For N=4 (one period 
with f=1), it can be seen that λ=c. For N=8, 𝜆 =

𝑐

 . 
2

The radius of the wave r is directly linked to half the wavelength: 

 𝑟  =

𝜆
2

As λ grows, the radius must also increase. 

Classically, it is described that gravity stretches space, increasing the wavelength and raising 
the radius of the wave circle. This happens because spacetime itself is stretched, making the 
oscillations of the wave appear slower (time dilation). 

In the theory of segmented spacetime, the increase in radius r corresponds to an increase in 
segments. With increasing gravity, space has more segments. Gravity adds more segments 
to space, and the wave must travel through more of these segments per period. 

This also results in an extension of the wavelength λ, allowing the radius r to grow 
accordingly. The increase in radius r corresponds to an increase in the number of segments 
N, as the radius directly scales the space. 

The relationship between gravity, radius, segments, and wavelength can be expressed as 
follows: 

𝑟 =

𝜆

2

 , 𝜆 =

4𝑐

𝑁

 , 𝑟 =

2𝑐

𝑁

Here it can be seen that as the number of segments N (more gravity) increases, the radius r 
grows, and the wavelength λ extends. 

Light has a wavelength of approximately 300,000 km, which corresponds to a circle with a 
large radius in normal conditions.

Light waves under the influence of gravity in segmented spacetime 

Under the influence of gravity, the wave becomes longer, and a redshift occurs. Let's assume 
a frequency of f=0.5 Hz (half vibration): 

𝜆 =

𝑐
𝑓

=

299792458 𝑚
0.5

= 599584916 𝑚 

Here, the wavelength is almost twice as large as in the normal state. The radius of the wave 
circle would double accordingly. 

Light travels 299,792,458 m in 1 second. If we divide this distance by 4 segments: 

𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑒𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  =

299792458 𝑚
4

    =  74948114.5 𝑚 

Under the influence of gravity (redshift), light travels 599,584,916 m in 1 second with a 
larger wavelength and lower frequency. Its speed remains constant. 

𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑒𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠  =

599,584,916 𝑚
74,948,114.5 𝑚

  =  8 

This corresponds exactly to twice the original segments - as we would expect if the 
frequency is halved. The number of segments increases proportionally to the wavelength 
expansion (λ′), and light dynamically adapts to gravity by traversing more segments while 
maintaining a constant speed of light (c). 

The number of segments (N) depends on the speed of light (c) and the distance per segment 
(ds): 

𝑁 =

𝑐
𝑑𝑠

In a vacuum, 𝑑𝑠 =

𝑐

 holds true.

Under the influence of gravity, when the frequency changes to f′ and the wavelength 
changes to λ′, the following is obtained:

With gravity (f=1 Hz, f′=0.5 Hz): 𝑁′ = 4 ∙

Thus, conclusions about the segmentation of space can be drawn from the change in 
wavelength. 

Segmentation inside a black hole 

In a previous paper[2], our focus was on the space surrounding a Kerr black hole. This unique 
object is characterized as a rotating black hole, with its properties determined by mass and 
angular momentum. In extreme cases, when the spin parameter a=M is reached, it is 
referred to as a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, where the event horizon reaches its 
minimum possible radius. The mathematical peculiarities that arise in this context remain 
unresolved challenges, making the Kerr black hole a fascinating subject of study. 

At the event horizon of a black hole, spacetime undergoes a fundamental transformation 
and essentially "tilts" or "folds." This boundary marks the point where gravity becomes so 
intense that the geometry of spacetime deviates radically from the structure we are familiar 
with. For this reason, the interior of a black hole cannot be treated in the same way as outer 
space. This also explains why the gravity of a black hole cannot be measured using 
conventional methods. 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
The visible space around the black hole behaves like a vacuum, while the invisible space 
within exerts immense gravitational forces. A black hole can therefore be considered a 
"space within a space," whose physical properties differ significantly from those of the 
external universe. 

If we were to calculate the segmentation using Euler's formula, the segmentation would 
approach infinity. At the point where the spiral would close at a radius of 1, the 
segmentation tends toward infinity. Physically, this corresponds to the concept of infinite 
density, commonly referred to as a singularity. This behavior presents significant challenges 
to modern physics and forms the foundation of the singularity problem. 

In this paper, we present a novel approach to addressing the problem of singularity by 
calculating the segmentation within black holes. Furthermore, we examine the behavior of 
light under these extreme conditions, demonstrating that light is not entirely trapped even 
within black holes. Our aim is to analyze this behavior in detail to gain a deeper 
understanding of the underlying mechanisms. 

We define a new growth spiral for the interior of the black hole. The spiral originates at the 
center of the black hole (r=0) and expands logarithmically, with the radius increasing as the 
angle θ grows. The spiral terminates at the boundary of the circle (r=R), where R represents 
the actual radius of the circle. 

To simplify the analysis, we set R=1, treating the system as dimensionless. This approach 
highlights the universality of the model, as any black hole with real-world dimensions can be 
understood as a scaled version of these conditions. By working with a normalized radius, the 
geometric relationships remain consistent and transferable, regardless of the black hole's 
physical size. 

The general formula for the logarithmic spiral is 

𝑟(θ) = r0 ∙ 𝑒𝑘θ 

Where 𝑘 =

2ln (𝜙)

𝜋

 is the growth rate of the spiral. The angle θ determines how many times 

the spiral twists before it reaches the edge. 

The spiral ends, if r(θ)=R. It follows: 

𝑅 = r0 ∙ 𝑒𝑘θmax 

To calculate the maximum angle θmax: 

θmax =

ln (𝑅 𝑟0)⁄
𝑘

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the midpoint is 𝑟 → 0 ist, we need to use a minimum starting value (f.e. r0 = 10-6), to avoid 
division by zero. 

This adjustment does not distort the segmentation results for several reasons. 

Firstly, the choice of a small but finite starting value ensures numerical stability without 
altering the overall behavior of the logarithmic spiral. The growth dynamics of the spiral are 
dominated by the logarithmic term, and the influence of the initial value r0 becomes 
negligible as the spiral expands outward. 

Secondly, since the segmentation primarily depends on the angular progression of the spiral 
and the logarithmic scaling of the radius, the starting point r0 only determines the position of 
the first segment. The subsequent segmentation follows the same proportional growth 
pattern regardless of the specific value of r0, as long as r0 is sufficiently small. 

Lastly, the use of a finite starting value is a practical necessity for numerical computations, 
and it reflects the physical reality that exact singularities (such as r=0) are idealized 
constructs. In practice, such singularities are not directly observed, and the introduction of r0 
aligns with the resolution limits of both theoretical and experimental approaches. 

Therefore, the segmentation calculated from this approach remains valid and accurate, as it 
faithfully represents the behavior of the spiral under real-world conditions. 

For every quarter turn (θ = 𝜋 2)⁄  the radius increases by the factor ϕ. The relationship is: 

𝑟(θ + 𝜋 2⁄ ) = 𝑟(θ) ∙ ϕ 

This means that the radius keeps multiplying by ϕ as the spiral grows. The spiral stops at the 
edge of the circle when r=R.  

In practical terms, this means that the spiral does not continue to grow indefinitely, but is 
limited by the circle. 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
The segmentation was calculated using a custom Python script, which implements the 
formula to analyze the spiral behavior. For reproducibility, the script is included in Appendix 
A. 

Using the Python script, we calculated the segmentation in the region near the event 
horizon of a black hole. The results demonstrated that the spiral structure at a radius of 1 
exhibits a segmentation of approximately 4 million segments. Contrary to traditional 
interpretations that predict infinite segmentation and lead to the concept of a singularity, 
our findings indicate that the segmentation stops at this finite value. 

This result challenges the notion of a true singularity, suggesting instead that the 
segmentation is naturally limited. This limitation provides a new perspective on the behavior 
of spacetime near black holes, avoiding the paradoxes associated with infinite density. 

Contrary to traditional interpretations that predict infinite segmentation and lead to the 
concept of a singularity, our findings indicate that the segmentation stops at this finite value. 

The number 4 million is not merely a result of the spiral calculation but a clue to the 
fundamental structure of the black hole. The base structure begins with 4 segments (4⋅ϕ0=4) 
and each segment grows proportionally to the logarithmic scaling of the spiral. This 
multiplication by ϕn results in a number that remains divisible by 4, as the starting value is 4. 

Segmentation, Rotation, and the Nature of Light 

The fundamental structure of space is defined by segmentation as soon as a photon appears. 
Instantly, it segments space into four fundamental segments and begins to rotate, 
immediately and without any acceleration. This is a unique characteristic of the light wave: It 
moves instantly at the speed of light (c), independent of gravity or external influences. This 
makes the concept of an ether unnecessary, as the light wave propagates directly through 
space without relying on a material medium. 

Thinking in terms of matter, which is tied to acceleration, leads to conceptual problems. 
Here, the nature of the wave motion is fundamentally different - at best comparable to the 
fall of the Berlin Wall in the DDR: Everything happened “immediately and without delay.”. 

Light and Gravity—A Common Misconception 

When considering a black hole, it’s often assumed that light is slowed down by gravity. 
However, this is not the case. The gravity of a black hole does not affect the speed of light 
but instead compresses its wavelength. This compression reduces the wavelength to a point 
where it becomes invisible and extremely difficult to detect. 

Since we succeeded in mathematically describing the segmentation inside a black hole, it 
now becomes possible to determine the range of minimum wavelengths for light within the 
black hole. These boundary values could provide new insights not only into the nature of 
light but also into the very structure of space and time. 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We set therefore into our formula those findings: 

𝜆 =

4𝑐
𝑁

λ =

4∙299792458 m 

4000000

=

299792458 m

1000000

=  299.792458 𝑚  

So we can now see that the gravity of a black hole compresses the wavelength of light into 
the range of short-wave radiation (radio waves). We cannot perceive this light with our eyes 
because our visual spectrum is limited to approximately 400 nm to 700 nm (visible light). 
Radio waves, on the other hand, have much longer wavelengths and can only be detected 
using specialized instruments such as radio telescopes. This is why a black hole appears black 
to us. 

The frequency of a wave is inversely proportional to its wavelength. At a wavelength of 
299.79 meters, the frequency is in the range of around 1 MHz (megahertz). Light waves 
compressed into the radio wave range with such low frequencies are only perceptible to us 
as signals (e.g., radio or radar) but no longer as "light." Radio telescopes could potentially 
detect these waves, especially if they originate from the event horizon or the vicinity of a 
black hole. 

Radio waves are extremely compressed upon entering the black hole due to the 
segmentation within the black hole, which encompasses millions of subdivisions. However, 
upon exiting, the light is only shifted back by 4 segments, as the space surrounding the black 
hole corresponds to a segmentation of just 4. This discrepancy explains why light that is 
highly compressed and high-frequency inside the black hole appears also as radio waves 
outside of the black hole.  

Let us see what happens when the light leaves the black hole again: 

λ =

4 ∙ 299792458 m 
4000000 − 4

=

4796679328 m
3999996

=  1199,171031171031 𝑚 

𝑓 =

299792458
1199,171031171031

= 249.999,75 𝐻𝑧 

The light in this case has now a wavelength of approximately 1.2 kilometers, which falls into 
the range of long-wave radio waves. The frequency of the wave is approximately 250 kHz or 
a bit higher.

Radio Waves and Information Transformation in Black Holes 

Radio waves have indeed been detected near black holes, but their exact origin has 
remained unexplained. Our own supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, also emits radio 
waves, which have been observed using radio telescopes like the Very Large Array (VLA). 
These radio waves originate from the vicinity of the event horizon[3]. 

We propose that visible light enters the black hole and emerges as radio waves. During this 
process, no information is lost—the light is merely transformed. These radio waves could 
carry a temporal "signature" that provides clues about the original light source and its 
interaction with spacetime segmentation. 

Through this temporal differentiation, it may be possible to trace how the original light wave 
was altered by gravity and segmentation. This approach could even allow for the 
reconstruction of the original information that entered the black hole. 

Conclusion and Future Implications 

The segmentation of spacetime provides a novel framework to understand the interaction of 
light and gravity near black holes. By proposing that visible light entering a black hole is 
transformed into radio waves, this model offers a fresh perspective on the nature of 
information preservation in extreme gravitational environments. This transformation 
challenges traditional views of black holes as ultimate sinks of information, instead 
suggesting a mechanism of redistribution and encoding. 

Future observations and experiments, particularly those utilizing advanced radio telescopes 
like the Event Horizon Telescope or the Square Kilometer Array, could help confirm or refine 
this model. The detection of temporal signatures or specific polarization patterns in radio 
waves near black holes may provide the evidence needed to support this hypothesis. 

This work highlights the importance of considering spacetime as a segmented structure, 
where the fundamental properties of light, rotation, and gravitation interplay in ways that 
can redefine our understanding of black holes and the universe itself.
