# Segmented Spacetime – Mass Projection & Unified Results
© Carmen Wrede und Lino Casu

This repository provides a full Python-based implementation and verification of the **Segmented Spacetime Mass Projection Model**, offering a high-precision, testable alternative to traditional gravitational models.

## 📌 Overview

The method implemented here reconstructs the **effective mass** of physical objects based on the principle of **space segmentation**, using a universal scaling function that links gravitational behavior across micro and macro scales.

### Included Features

- ✅ Unified segment-based mass inversion from observed radii
- ✅ Comparison with established experimental values (e.g. electron mass, planetary bodies)
- ✅ Reproduction of classical observables (e.g. Mercury's perihelion, black hole shadow radius)
- ✅ Symbolic check for modified Einstein tensor compatibility (`Gμν = 0`)

## 📁 Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `segmented_full_proof.py` | Main Python script to run all results and outputs |
| `README.md` | You're reading it. |

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then simply run:

```bash
python segmented_full_proof.py
````

## ⚙️ Setup with Virtual Environment

To keep your environment clean and reproducible, it's recommended to run this project inside a virtual environment.

### 🧰 Steps

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment (folder name: venv)
python3 -m venv venv

# 2. Activate the environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
