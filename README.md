# Segmented Spacetime ‚Äì Mass Projection & Unified Results
¬© Carmen Wrede & Lino Casu

This repository provides a full Python-based implementation and verification of the **Segmented Spacetime Mass Projection Model**, offering a high-precision, testable alternative to traditional gravitational models.

## üìå Overview

The method implemented here reconstructs the **effective mass** of physical objects based on the principle of **space segmentation**, using a universal scaling function that links gravitational behavior across micro and macro scales.

### Included Features

- ‚úÖ Unified segment-based mass inversion from observed radii
- ‚úÖ Comparison with established experimental values (e.g. electron mass, planetary bodies)
- ‚úÖ Reproduction of classical observables (e.g. Mercury's perihelion, black hole shadow radius)
- ‚úÖ Symbolic check for modified Einstein tensor compatibility (`GŒºŒΩ = 0`)

`calculation_test.py`

`calculation_test.py` is the quick-start entry point for the **cycle-free mass calculation** via segment radius `r_phi`.

| Option / Mode      | Description                                                                                                  |

## ‚úÖ `final_test.py` ‚Äì Roundtrip Validation of Segmented-Spacetime Mass Reconstruction

This script demonstrates that the segmented-spacetime model can reconstruct the rest mass of an object purely from its segmented radius ‚Äì without relying on built-in constants like the Compton wavelength or classical radius.

### What It Does

- Takes known rest masses of test objects (electron, Moon, Earth, Sun).
- Computes the segmented radius using:

  r_phi = (G * m / c^2) * phi

- Then inverts that radius back into mass via:

  m = (c^2 * r_phi) / (G * phi)

- Finally, it compares the original mass (M_in) with the reconstructed mass (M_out), and prints the relative error.

### Why It Matters

- No circular dependency: The mass is not hidden in the inputs.
- No use of Compton wavelength or predefined scale lengths.
- The reconstruction is based only on geometry and physical constants.

This test directly avoids the circular logic found in other models, where mass is inserted via lambda_C and reappears in the result.

### Example Output

Segmented-Spacetime Roundtrip Mass Validation

## Objekt     M\_in \[kg]     r\_phi \[m]       M\_out \[kg]     rel. error

Electron   9.1094e-31    1.0946e-57      9.1094e-31      1.10e-50

Moon       7.3420e+22    8.8220e-5       7.3420e+22      1.36e-50

Earth      5.9722e+24    7.1761e-3       5.9722e+24      <1e-42

Sun        1.9885e+30    2.3893e+3       1.9885e+30      <1e-42

### Conclusion

The `final_test.py` script confirms:

- The segmented-spacetime model does not rely on hidden mass inputs.
- It is free of circular logic.
- Mass is derived from geometric structure alone.
- The numerical error is near machine precision.


This is a clean and direct demonstration that mass can be reconstructed from segmented spacetime ‚Äì without assumptions, without shortcuts.

## `complete-math.py` ‚Äî Step-by-Step Script for Segmented Spacetime Theory

This script provides a **fully commented, didactic, and transparent step-by-step demonstration** of all key calculations from the papers by Carmen Wrede & Lino Casu, implementing the ‚ÄúSegmented Spacetime‚Äù model:

### What does the script do?

- **Mass reconstruction** from the segmented radius using the œÜ/2 constant and exponential correction, with **true Newtonian decimal-precision inversion**.
- **Calculation of the local fine-structure constant** Œ± from a measured frequency (e.g., as in the S2/Sgr A* test), and computation of the associated bound electron mass and threshold photon wavelength.
- **Every single calculation step is explicitly explained in the output** ‚Äî including all inputs, intermediate results, mathematical formulas, and the physical meaning of each result.

### Features

- **Explains every formula and physical constant** directly in the printout, line by line.
- **Reproduces the Earth mass example** from segmented radius, showing both theory and inversion.
- **Shows how to derive Œ±<sub>local</sub> and m<sub>bound</sub>** from a single observed frequency.
- **Checks mathematical consistency** (e.g. Œ± √ó m<sub>bound</sub> √ó c¬≤ / h should recover the input frequency).
- **Ideal for reviewers, teaching, or anyone who wants to understand the model without reading the full paper**.

### Usage

```bash
python complete-math.py

### Why is there an energy difference between emitter and detector? (Physical explanation)

The script `carmen_qed_incompleteness_demo.py` demonstrates that the classical idea of a photon "losing energy" as it travels through a gravitational field is incomplete.  
In the segmented spacetime model, the **measured energy at the detector** (e.g., on Earth) does **not** decrease because the photon "loses" energy, but because the **local segmentation** (the discrete structure of space at the detector) limits how much energy can be extracted from the photon.

- The photon's energy remains constant along its entire path.
- However, our measuring instruments (the electrons on Earth) can only "tap" a **fraction of the original photon energy** ‚Äì this fraction is set by the local segmentation parameter (N).
- The stronger the gravitational field and the higher the segmentation at the detector, the less energy can be accessed from the original photon.
- The apparent energy loss is thus **not a real energy loss of the photon itself**, but an effect of the spacetime structure at the detector.

**Conclusion:**  
The observed energy difference is directly explained by our model ‚Äì it is not due to energy dissipation "on the way", but to the **local coupling/segmentation** between the photon and the detector.

## QED Incompleteness Demo (`carmen_qed_incompleteness_demo.py`)

This script demonstrates why the classical formula `E = m_e * c^2` and even QED are incomplete when strong gravity or segmented spacetime are present:

- It uses a real astrophysical example (S2 star and Earth) to show how local segmentation (N) affects the measurable energy and the local electron mass.
- The script calculates, from observed and emitted frequencies, the local fine-structure constant (`alpha_local`) and the bound electron mass (`m_bound`).
- It explains and numerically demonstrates why, at the detector (e.g., on Earth), only a **portion of the original photon energy** can be accessed.
- All formulas, calculation steps, and interpretations are printed and explained.

**How to run:**
```bash
python carmen_qed_incompleteness_demo.py
